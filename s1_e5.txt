Oh, is it this guy?
Never travel without it.

<i>Stop holding up the line, idiot!</i>

5
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:21,108
It's not his fault.
He's just doing his job.

6
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,776
<i>It's your fault, dummy.</i>

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,819
I'm sorry, sir, no
liquid over three ounces.

8
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:26,946
This is Pappy Van Winkle, friend.

9
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,115
Do you know how old this bourbon is?
If this was a person,

10
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,241
I would've stopped having
sex with it a year ago.

11
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,701
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Do you know who I am?

<i>Come on.</i>

13
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,036
I'm actually a huge celebrity
on my way to New York

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,372
for an important meeting
with a book publisher,

15
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:45,167
who wants to publish a book
about me because I am famous.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,627
- That's not...
- Fine, you want me to dance?

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,711
I'll dance.

18
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,714
Give me ten seconds, Diane.

19
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:54,341
This guy's being a total fascist.
Diane?

20
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,717
- Diane?
- Over here, BoJack.

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,344
How'd you get through so fast?

22
00:00:58,427 --> 00:00:59,969
I followed the basic
requirements for air travel

23
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:01,387
that have been in place for over a decade.

24
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:04,097
- Ugh, weird.
- Sir, whoever you are, please...

25
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:06,516
Really?
You've never heard of my TV show?

26
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,392
You know very well who I am.

27
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:10,519
And now if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to New York.

28
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:12,145
<i>Ah, no.</i>

29

<i>- More?
- Come on!</i>

30
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:15,272
Oh, you know what?
Could be this.

31
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:16,939
Oh, my God, he's got a gun.

32
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:19,192
Relax, it's a lighter.

33
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,193
How much lighter fluid
can I take on the plane?

34
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:23,945
And before you answer,
remember, I'm a celebrity.

35
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:26,238
We're gonna need a full body cavity search.

<i>Thanks for coming to New York for this.</i>

38

Let's just say, it's better
for everyone's kneecaps

39
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:33,036
if I stay out of
California for a little bit.

40
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,454
Always nice to get a change
of scenery, am I right?

41
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,538
I think the New York air's
been good for my health.

42
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:41,459
I mean, I did find a lump,
but hey, who needs health insurance

Horseman writing a book, huh?

How's it coming along?

45
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:50,186
It's great. I'm pumping out
heartfelt anecdotes and witty

46
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:53,926
observations left and right, and
this one is spinning it all into gold.

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,182
<i>and your phone's story

51
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,476
- Excuse me. Hello?
- Hurry back, superstar.

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,019
I don't think Diane's working out.

53
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,689
- What? Why? Is Diane no good?
- She's too good.

54
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,232
I don't know if Diane is
damaged enough to tell my story.

55
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,316
She's so... functional.

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,569
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Horseman,
she's too functional.

57
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:21,696
Why don't I just get on the phone
and call a less functional...

58
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,615
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:26,700
- This is a very bad time, BoJack!
- All right.

60
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:29,167
You need to promise me that your book

61
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,662
will be on the shelves and
making money by October!

62
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,329
All right. Jesus.

63
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,581
<i>Uh-huh?
Uh-huh.</i>

64
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:37,999
Uh-huh.
Got it. Sorry I took so long.

65
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,542
Who was that? The library?

66
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:42,002
Thanking you for never
returning a book late?

67
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:43,920
That was my brother Tommy.
My dad just died.

68
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:45,505
Oh, my God.

69
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:47,005
Did we talk about firming
up the release date?

70
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:48,882
- I was thinking late September.
- I am so sorry.

71
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:50,717
It's fine, he was old and also the worst.

72
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:54,261
Such a terrible tragedy
really puts everything in perspective.

73
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:56,464
Where does that leave us as
far as the book of it all?

74
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:59,098
Not a problem.
I just got to swing by Boston

75
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:01,975
and give my condolences real quick.
BoJack can come with me.

76
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:03,856
We'll get some work done
while we're there, and then

77
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,686
that way the whole trip won't
be a total waste of time.

78
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,062
Great.
Call me if you need anything,

79
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:11,066
but hang up after one ring,
and I'll call you back

80

<i>and until then, don't do anything.</i>

95
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:55,054
Well, seal's broken.
Might as well enjoy myself.

96
00:04:58,182 --> 00:04:59,517
Whee!

97
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:03,144

<i>Ohh!</i>

103
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,828
Sounds like we have some fans
of Person of Interest on board,

104
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,954
or Castle, or whatever his show is.

105
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,415
Sorry, dudes, you got the wrong house.

106
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,957
<i>Aww.</i>

107
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:38,795
Crikey, I would've paid $50 U.S.
to see where David Boreanaz lives.

108
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,754
He's the American Hugh Jackman.

109
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:43,382
<i>- Oh, yeah, 50 bucks?
- He's so good in Burn Notice.</i>

110
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,216
What? 50 bucks?

111
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,009
In that case, come on in, friends.

112
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,093
Some guy named David Boreanaz lives here.

113
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:52,054
<i>Hooray!</i>

114
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:53,681
Hey, so listen,

115
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:55,598
I really want to be here
for you in your time of need,

116
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:57,308
but I'm not really good
with funerals or death

117
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:58,934
or families or feelings or people.

118
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,769
Don't worry. You can wait in the car.

119
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:02,436
It's probably better you
don't meet my brothers.

120
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,731
They're narrow-minded,
mean-spirited dirtbags.

121
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,648
I wish I had brothers growing up.

122
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:10,234
Touch football on the weekends,
noogie parades on the reg.

123
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:13,152
Life as an only child
can get pretty lonely.

124
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:16,238
Daddy, do you want to
meet my imaginary friend?

125
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:20,783
Imaginary friends are freeloaders
invented by communists to rip-off welfare.

126
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,994
Why don't you do something
productive, like bang your

127
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:25,155
head against the wall until
your brain isn't so stupid?

128
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:26,663
Okay, Daddy.

129
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:29,307
Yeah, well, I was pretty
lonely, too. My family made my

130
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:31,958
life miserable, and then they
never forgave me for leaving.

131
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,626
So, what, you're like the black sheep?

132
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,460
No, Gary's the black sheep.
He's adopted.

133
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:37,254
I'm just the member of
the family nobody likes.

134
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:39,129
And my dad was the worst of them all.

135
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,028
You told me that you
and your father used to

136
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,883
sit on the roof and look
at the stars together.

137
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:45,551
Oh, yeah, I was just trying
to get you to open up,

138
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:48,553
so I used an old writer's
trick called "me lying to you."

139
00:06:48,636 --> 00:06:50,722
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm using an old me trick

140
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,264
called "that hurts my feelings."

141
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:55,501
And the truth is, I used to
sit alone on the hill out by the

142
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:58,811
dump and dream of waking up as
Chelsea Clinton, but with my hair.

143
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:01,730
- You do have great hair.
- I know.

144
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:07,024
That's us.
I'll just pop in for a quick hi and bye.

145
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,902
Then we'll be on our way.
Ten minutes, swear to God.

146
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:12,385
You can play with this kaleidoscope
I got you at the airport.

147
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:16,156
What? A kaleidoscope?
I'm not five...

148
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,617
Shapes and colors the likes
of which I've never seen.

149
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,492
Hello.

150
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:23,328
Hey, yeah, Deedee came home!

151
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:26,330
Gary, Marty, Artie, Deedee's back!
Come here!

152
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:28,039
Game. Watching the game.

153
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:29,416
Can't look up from the game.
How you doing?

154
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,501
Marty, it's a game from '86.
You've seen it a hundred times.

155
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,336
And how many times does
Buckner break your heart?

156
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,879
<i>100 times.</i>

157
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,798
Aw, thank
God you're here, Deedee.

158
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,339
Pops is wicked departed.

159
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:41,341
Oh, yeah, man. He departed so hard.

160
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,551
And I do not like them apples, Deedee.

161
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:44,886
Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.

162
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,177
Yeah, make that two, Deedee.

163
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,305
Gary, Marty, I just got home.

164
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:52,975
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't
want to get her brother a beer.

165
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:55,477
Hey, Ma, come look what
the Pats dragged in.

166
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,271
Oh, hello!
Look who decided to come home.

167
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:05,150
Queen Deedee blesses us with her presence.
To what do I owe the honor?

168
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,026
Look, I'm just here to
offer my condolences.

169
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:11,029
Oh, sure, in and out, like
a Protestant on Christmas.

170
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:12,512
Why would you want to stick around,

171
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:13,906
be with your family in their time of need?

172
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,700
- Come on, Ma.
- Don't fight while the game's on.

173
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:19,744
- It's bad Juju.
- It's the '86 World Series.

174
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:22,329
- They lose.
- Ah, why'd you have to...

175
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,456
Oh, we're just a bunch of savages, right?

176
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,958
We're not like your
fancy California friends.

177
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,543
Your George Clooney and
your California Raisins.

178
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,920
Oh, come off it, Ma.
She don't mean no harm.

179
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,212
For five years she didn't come home.

180
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:37,966
Why don't you make like A-Rod and blow.

181
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,634
Well, this was clearly a huge mistake.

182
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:43,552
Ah, don't go.
Deedee, please.

183
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,220
Why not? Ma doesn't want me here.

184
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:47,180
Ma don't know what she wants.

185
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:50,098
She wants you here. We all do.
Ain't that right, Marty?

186
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:51,350
Can't look up from the game.

187
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:54,143
Besides, we need your help
organizing all the funeral stuff.

188
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,728
We didn't go to college.
We're not smart like you.

189
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:59,439
Fine, I'll help.
Is there a number for me to call?

190
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:02,107
Yeah, try
1-800-The-Internet, dummy.

191
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,900
Jeez, do some legwork, Dee.

192
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:06,361
And do it quick.
The ice is melting.

193
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,362
Oh, my God. Is that dad?

194
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:11,238
Did someone draw balls on his forehead?

195
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,033
That was before we knew he was dead.

196
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:14,992
We just thought he was wicked hung over.

197
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:20,079
In your face, Dad!
In your face forever.

198
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:24,541
<i>Welcome to the
home of David Boreanaz,</i>

199
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:26,375
famous from television shows

200
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,670
such as dramas on networks.

201
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,504
That will be $50 please.

202
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:35,965
Oy, mate, this picture of
David Boreanaz fell apart.

203
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,505
Oh, no, no, no, I'll handle
that. Why don't you just

204
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:41,053
go look through David Boreanaz's
underwear drawer, okay?

205
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,804
- It's in his bedroom.
- Oh, knickers.

206
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,472
<i>Hey, what do
you think you're doing?</i>

207
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:47,431
Uh-oh, am I reading something again?

208
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:50,059
<i>No, this is your conscience.</i>

209
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:52,644
<i>BoJack trusted you to
take care of his house.</i>

210
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,937
<i>Is this really... What are you doing?</i>

211
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:00,733
<i>♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun ♪</i>

212
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,192
<i>♪ Dun-dun-dun... ♪</i>

213
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:05,778
It's a great day on Todd's phone.
How can I help you?

214
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,488
Are you trying to cut me out
of this David Boreanaz deal?

215
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:09,031
I'm your agent, damn it.

216
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:10,908
How'd you find out about Boreanaz House?

217
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:12,783
Don't worry, I'm not just gonna sit here

218
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,869
batting a ball of yarn around
while you do the real work.

219
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,913
I want to take your
project to the next level.

220
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:19,705
We need to go bigger.

221
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:21,957
Have you thought about attaching
Mila Kunis to this thing?

222
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:26,126
- Attach her? How?
- You do your job. I'll do mine.

223
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,253
Who is this?

224
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,090
Ah, out of combinations.
Now I'm bored.

225
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,507
Diaaaaane!

226
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,927
- You show me nothing...
- What do you want from me?

227
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,928
You have no right to barge
in here after five years

228
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:43,680
- and judge us, Diane.
- I'm just saying Marty could lend a hand

229
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:45,682
instead of sitting on the
couch watching the game all day.

230
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:49,602
- Ah, Deedee.
- You know very well his leg's still sore

231
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:51,352
from the accident at the quarry.

232
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:54,521
Yeah, he's got to rest up if he's
gonna be a wide receiver for B.C.

233
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,356
He didn't get into B.C.

234
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,357
Ah, what's the point of
getting off the couch anyway?

235
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,526
All the jobs are going
to immigrants these days.

236
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,527
What do you... We're immigrants.

237
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,529
- How do you figure?
- We're Vietnamese?

238
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,989
Step off! We're American as fuck.

239
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:08,489
<i>And that's the same crap you always pull...</i>

240
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:11,451
<i>What do you want from me?
Come on!</i>

241
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,453
Excuse me.
Yes, hello, I'm looking for Diane.

242
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:16,121
Does anyone here speak English?

243
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,623
Pull over and park the car.

244
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:21,499
Is that the frickin'
horse from Horsin' Around?

245
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,334
Again, does anyone here speak English?

246
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:28,046
- Oh, no way...
- What? A TV star!

247
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:31,632
Boreanaz house.

248
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:34,008
Seventy-five each.
Children and seniors free.

249
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,457
Please stay behind
the ropes and keep your

250
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,096
hands and belongings on
your person at all times.

251
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,889
Next we'll head to the kitchen where...
Is that Mila Kunis?

252
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:43,515
<i>Ooh!</i>

253
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,350
Note the letters B.H. on
all hand towels and linens.

254
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,435
That stands for "Boreanaz House."

255
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:54,856
Yeah, do you pick up bodies?

256
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,942
Is that a service you provide?
Corpse removal?

257
00:11:57,025 --> 00:12:00,319
Hey, BoJack, you ever meet
any Boston celebrities?

258
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,195
Well, one time at Bristol Farms,

259
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,281
Ben Affleck and I did reach
for the same bunch of grapes.

260
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:09,951
Oh, he eats grapes just like us?
Hey, Ma, Ben Affleck eats grapes!

261
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:11,619
<i>He don't eat grapes!</i>

262
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:14,329
BoJack said he fed Affleck grapes.

263
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,664
He was graping it up with
the Daredevil himself.

264
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:20,875
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Oh!

265
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,796
Hey, I don't suppose
you boys would have any

266
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:24,878
interest in maybe playing
some touch football later?

267
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:27,672
Are you kidding?
Touch football with a star like you?

268
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:29,715
That would be mad wicked pisser.

269
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,279
Ooh, you know what else we got to do?

270
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:34,218
We got to watch the Cryane video.

271
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,845
Ooh, that sounds good.
What's that?

272
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:38,972
- No, we don't need to revisit that.
- When Deedee was 16,

273
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:41,723
we made up a secret pen pal
for her named Leo.

274
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:45,101
Guys, I really would rather not discuss it.

275
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:47,020
We all took turns writing her letters,

276
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:50,271
pretending to be this
sensitive boy from Cambridge.

277
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:52,023
It was wicked messed up.

278
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:55,399
"Oh, Diane, we're two misunderstood souls.

279
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,778
Everyone else is a phony.
Yours forever, Leo."

280
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,865
- What? That is amazing.
- After six months of letters,

281
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,366
we hired a homeless
guy to pretend to be Leo

282
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,910
and take her to the homecoming dance.

283
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:10,327
- Look at her.
- Watch, watch this part.

284
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,536
<i>I like your boutonniÃ¨re.</i>

285
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:16,915
<i>Why don't we watch this every day?</i>

286
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:18,291
- Look at her face.
- Now that's a good prank.

287
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,127
- I was humiliated.
- Yeah, you wouldn't get it.

288
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:22,962
It's a brothers thing, right, brothers?

289
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:26,381
Whoo! That's Cryane for you.
What a pussy.

290
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:29,633
You know, it's nice that years later
we can all laugh about this.

291
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:31,551
Yep, my therapist thinks the same thing.

292
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,511
I'm gonna go meet with
the funeral director.

293
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:35,179
Any of you boys want to come?

294
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:37,097
Nah, I ain't so big on
funeral homes, Deedee.

295
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:38,723
All them dead bodies,
they give me the jeebies.

296
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:41,267
Yeah, Deedee, why do we got to go?

297
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,769
Fine, none of you have to go.
I'll take care of everything.

298
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,653
Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.

299
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:49,908
- Come on, BoJack.
- Why you got to take BoJack with you?!

300
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:50,732
Boo!

301
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:53,234
- Boo!
- Boys, you have stolen my heart

302
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:54,985
like Dave Roberts stole second base.

303
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,195
Hey! He knows our things!

304
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,738
I must go now, but I'll see
you all at the funeral, okay?

305
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:02,282
And when I do, you're all getting noogies.

306
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:03,365
- Funeral!
- Yeah!

307
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:04,449
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

308
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,659
<i>Funeral!</i>

309
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:06,951
<i>Funeral! Funeral!</i>

310
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:12,748
And now, a very special treat
just for our platinum members.

311
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:18,752
Let's take a peek at the slumbering
Mr. Boreanaz himself.

312
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:22,421
<i>Get out of my room, Todd!
I'm David Boreanaz.</i>

313
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:24,048
<i>Ohh!</i>

314
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,590
And thus concludes our tour.

315
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:27,425
Have a Boreanderful day.

316
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,761
Tell me about your father.

317
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:35,462
Well, he was a mean, sadistic
alcoholic, who never supported

318
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:38,724
anything I did and actively
delighted in seeing me fail.

319
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:42,560
Hmm, I see.
Sounds like you're looking for

320
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:44,353
our Piece of Shit Dad Package.

321
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:46,272
That would be too good for my father.

322
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:49,679
Hmm, I see.
Might I then suggest our

323
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,651
Piece of Shit Dad Package
Would Be Too Good For Him Package.

324
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:57,487
- Yeah, that's the one.
- Excellent choice.

325
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:59,531
Hey, can I suggest something?

326
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:01,783
You might want to loosen up a little.

327
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,617
I think you could actually
learn a thing or two

328
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,411
- from your brothers.
- Are you kidding?

329
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,537
If I was like my brothers,
nothing would ever get done.

330
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:11,699
I'm just saying, if you
can't find a way to let off

331
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,541
some steam you're going to explode.

332
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,376
<i>God damn it!
Are you god damn kidding me?</i>

333
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,961
I keep getting calls
from this unlisted number.

334
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:19,879
Ignore. Who are these assholes?

335
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:21,588
Why don't you just answer,
and then you'll know?

336
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,311
Oh, they'd just love that, wouldn't they?

337
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,759
Ugh, how are we supposed to
blackmail him if we can't reach him?

338
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,219
Maybe we got to get him where he lives?

339
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:33,639
- You mean...?
- That's right, his house.

340
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,515
<i>What the... Whose house is this?</i>

341
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,684
Is that David Boreanaz?

342
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:41,603
I could've sworn BoJack
Horseman lived here.

343
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,286
Hey, let's keep these lines moving, huh?

344
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:46,648
You want to stop and chat, you gotta
pay for the extended stay ticket.

345
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:48,650
Ah, so much, so much, so much.

346
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,735
Another five Gs, T-Bag,
and we are in the pink.

347
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:53,237
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

348
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:56,906
I ran out of shoeboxes for the money,
and the books aren't adding up.

349
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,890
Plus the men's lav needs
to be serviced, and I had to

350
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:02,952
fire Janine in the gift shop
for stealing Boreabble heads.

351
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:05,745
I mean, how did I end up
with all this responsibility?

352
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:07,955
Hey, I'm not screwing
around here, small fry.

353
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:11,514
- You better make those numbers sing.
- I don't think these offshore

354
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:14,210
banks we've been using
are 100% legal.

355
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:16,670
Yeah, well, my mother told
me never to slap an idiot.

356
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:18,046
What? Ow!

357
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,047
Now we're both breaking the rules.

358
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:22,866
You listen, and you listen
good. I've gotten used to

359
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,550
a certain lifestyle since
Boreanaz House went public,

360
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,219
and I'm not going back to the old way.

361
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:30,096
Mommy likes her shoes, see?
And her pearls.

362
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,431
Oh, I'm in too deep.
I don't know what to do.

363
00:16:33,515 --> 00:16:34,975
<i>I'll tell you what you should do.</i>

364
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,143
Who said that?

365
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:37,685
<i>It's me, David Boreanaz.</i>

366
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:40,020
Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like?

367
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:43,148
<i>Uh, sure.
Let me give you some advice.</i>

368
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:46,359
<i>As we say on my show...
I want to say, New Girl?...</i>

369
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:48,776
<i>just keep doing what you're
doing, and you'll be fine.</i>

370
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,944
Wow, thanks, Davie B.

371
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:53,864
<i>Never call me that!</i>

372
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:59,368
- Unbelievable.
- It's 4:00. I don't think anyone's coming.

373
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,119
Unbe-goddamn-lievable!

374
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:06,622
All those jerk wads had to do was show up,
and they couldn't even do that!

375
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,082
Where's the body even?

376
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,417
Beg your pardon, minor hiccup.

377
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,712
My goons went to pick your
father up, but nobody was home.

378
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:17,922
For a nominal fee, we can
scrounge up another body for you.

379
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:22,051
Would you care to peruse our loaner closet?

380
00:17:24,552 --> 00:17:26,928
Hey, assholes! Where were you?

381
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,306
I planned the whole funeral,
like you asked me to,

382
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,648
- and nobody showed.
- Yeah, we realized dad wouldn't

383
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:34,434
have wanted some stuffy funeral.

384
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:36,686
He would've wanted his body
to be chopped up into chum

385
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:40,397
- and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face.
- Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

386
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,148
Wait, what? Where is Dad?

387
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:43,900
We got him chummed. He's in the truck.

388
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:50,238
- You chummed Dad?
- It's what your father wanted, honey,

389
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:53,198
but then you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

390
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,075
Let me get this straight.
So instead of coming to the funeral

391
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,118
that I paid for and
spent all day organizing,

392
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:02,246
you had Dad's body ground into chum,

393
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,664
so you could throw his
mushy remains on Derek Jeter?

394
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:10,001
No, not just on Derek Jeter.
We're gonna throw it into his fat face.

395
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:11,502
- Yeah, his fat face.
- In his fat face.

396
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:12,946
The Yankees are in town this week.

397
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:14,338
The planets are aligning, Deedee.

398
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,923
Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.

399
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:20,384
Why does everything always
got to be about big-shot Diane?

400
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:24,845
- Too good for her home.
- I don't think I'm too good for my home.

401
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,846
Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong.

402
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,266
Diane isn't a big-shot.
She's my ghostwriter.

403
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:33,893
She's writing a book that's not
even gonna have her name on it.

404
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:37,272
You think this is how she expected
her life would be going at 34?

405
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:40,441
She lives with her rich
boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.

406
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:44,026
She's not too good for anything.

407
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,694
- What?
- Diane's a freeloader?

408
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:51,906
- Even I pay rent.
- BoJack helping?

409
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:58,412
Whoa.

410
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:03,164
This is why I told you to wait in the car!

411
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:05,792
Oh, she snapped.
Here comes Cryane.

412
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,502
Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.

413
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:12,546
Diane, you are making a
public spectacle of yourself.

414
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,090
Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys?

415
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:16,590
Put those back.

416
00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:18,092
Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck.

417
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,510
Dad's chum is in the back.

418
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,094
No! No, no, no!

419
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:23,554
<i>Suck a dick, dumb shits!</i>

420
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:26,223
Well, that crazy clam did it.
She took Pops.

421
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:29,534
Oh, no, what are we gonna do?

422
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:31,768
<i>And it's a
one-hopper back to the pitcher.</i>

423
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:35,521
Easy out at first.
So what we're gonna do is nothing?

424
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,648
Sox are on, and I haven't seen this one.

425
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:39,649
Does anyone know where
she might have gone?

426
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:41,532
Ah, she used to run off
like this all the time

427
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:44,903
in high school, too.
Who knows where crazy goes?

428
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:47,196
I think I know where she went.

429
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,491
Wait, you can't leave.
The party's just getting started.

430
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:52,908
I don't know, Diane was pretty upset,

431
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:56,786
- and she's got your dad.
- Oh, don't go, BoJack.

432
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,371
You're like the fifth brother I never had.

433
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:01,081
- I... Really?
- Yeah, don't leave, bro.

434
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:04,208
After this, we'll go play touch football
and do a noogie parade.

435
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,668
Ah, um...

436
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:08,962
<i>Everyone please disperse.</i>

437
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:12,965
<i>This is an unlawful gathering.
Disperse immediately.</i>

438
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,510
Oh, this isn't looking
good, Princess Carolyn.

439
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,386
- What are we gonna do?
- What do you mean, we?

440
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,013
Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.

441
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,097
Ha!

442
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,889
Mr. Boreanaz, I presume.

443
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,434
Um, would you like a Boreabble head?

444
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,187
The amazing thing is, the house
looks just like BoJack's house.

445
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,063
They must have the same architect.

446
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:35,689
Anyway, how are things with you?

447
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,232
<i>Not good.</i>

448
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:39,817
<i>I should've known it was a
waste of time to come back here.</i>

449
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,819
Oh, that's awful.
Well, when you get back,

450
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:44,821
I'll give you one of my
patented Peanutbutter hugs.

451
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:46,738
Crunchy and creamy.

452
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:50,408
You know that patent wasn't
approved, but I'll take it.

453
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:54,537
<i>- I have to go. BoJack's here.
- BoJack, well, what's he doing...?</i>

454
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:58,164
Hey.
Sorry I said all that stuff about you.

455
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:00,374
It's all true, isn't it?

456
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:04,168
I found this letter back at the bar.
I think it's for you.

457
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,962
Look, just read it.
I think you'll like it.

458
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:12,757
"Dear Diane, it's me, your old pen pal Leo.

459
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:15,926
This definitely isn't BoJack
Horseman writing this."

460
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,220
Keep reading.

461
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:19,221
"You're a good person, Diane,

462
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:21,514
and that's the most important thing.

463
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,307
Even if no one appreciates you,

464
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:25,975
it's important that you
don't stop being good.

465
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,353
I like how you always bring your
own bags to the grocery store,

466
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:32,063
and how you're always
organized to go places.

467
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:36,107
I like how you chew gum on the
airplane so your ears will pop.

468
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:39,109
A lot of people might not
appreciate that about you,

469
00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:42,778
but I do.
Yours forever, Leo."

470
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:45,365
That's the best letter he ever wrote me.

471
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:48,450
Look, take it from someone
with his own shitty parents,

472
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,326
family is a sinkhole,

473
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,530
and you were right to get
out when you had the chance.

474
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,130
The stupid thing is,
even now I still just want

475
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,415
them to be proud of me
and think I did good.

476
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:59,291
Is that really stupid?

477
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,584
- Yep.
- No, it isn't.

478
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,878
Yeah, it is.
You want those guys to be proud of you?

479
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:06,201
I guess I was just hoping to
get some modicum of closure.

480
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:09,965
Closure is a made up thing
by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.

481
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:14,135
It, like true love and the Munich Olympics,
doesn't exist in the real world.

482
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:17,763
The only thing to do now is
just to keep living forward.

483
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:20,306
Yeah, but every time
I come back here they...

484
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,642
So don't come back here.
What's great about Los Angeles

485
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:26,269
is nobody cares about where
you're from or who you are.

486
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:29,271
It's a superficial town
where you can worry about stupid shit

487
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:30,813
like keeping your pool clean,

488
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:32,657
and what artisanal nuts
to put on your salad.

489
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:35,526
- I do like salad.
- Oh, it's the best.

490
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,986
- Why do you think people keep moving there?
- Thanks, BoJack.

491
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,281
The good news is, your dad
can't hurt anyone ever again.

492
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,824
Uh-oh.

I thought a big baseball hotshot like you

497
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,088
would be too busy to help us
old ladies across the street.

498
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:06,756
I always have time to
look out for my elders,

499
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,799

You know what to do.

Hey, Herb, look, I think we
have some unfinished business.

507
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:36,278
It seems like life's
too short to hold grudges

508
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:38,655
and stuff like that,
you know what I'm saying?

509
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:41,364
About life being too short?
Well, of course you know what I'm saying.

I feel like I'm doing all the talking here.

511
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:46,702
So anyway, I thought maybe we could chat.

512
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:48,786
Why don't you give me a call, okay?

513

Um... so smell you later?

Obviously.

515
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,337
Ugh, who keeps calling me?

516
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,922
Come on, BoJack.
Pick up, pick up.

517
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:05,423
I'm sure he'll pick up.
