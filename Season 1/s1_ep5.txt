BOJACK: Oh, is it this guy?
Never travel without it.
It's not his fault.
He's just doing his job.
This is Pappy Van Winkle, friend.
Do you know how old this bourbon is?
If this was a person,
I would've stopped having
sex with it a year ago.
Do you know who I am?
I'm actually a huge celebrity
on my way to New York
for an important meeting
with a book publisher,
who wants to publish a book
about me because I am famous.
Fine, you want me to dance?
I'll dance.
Give me ten seconds, Diane.
This guy's being a total fascist.
Diane? Diane?

DIANE: Over here, BoJack.

BOJACK: How'd you get through so fast?

DIANE: I followed the basic
requirements for air travel
that have been in place for over a decade.

BOJACK: Ugh, weird.
Really?
You've never heard of my TV show?
You know very well who I am.
And now if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to New York.
Oh, you know what?
Could be this.
Relax, it's a lighter.
How much lighter fluid
can I take on the plane?
And before you answer,
remember, I'm a celebrity.
Always nice to get a change of
scenery am I right?
It's great. I'm pumping out
heartfelt anecdotes and witty
observations left and right, and
this one is spinning it all into gold.

DIANE: Excuse me. Hello?

BOJACK: Hurry back, superstar.
I don't think Diane's working out.
She's too good.
I don't know if Diane is
damaged enough to tell my story.
She's so... functional.
All right.


DIANE: Uh-huh?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Got it. Sorry I took so long.

BOJACK: Who was that? The library?
Thanking you for never
returning a book late?

DIANE: That was my brother Tommy.
My dad just died.

BOJACK: Oh, my God.

DIANE: Did we talk about firming
up the release date?
I was thinking late September.

BOJACK: I am so sorry.

DIANE: It's fine, he was old and also the worst.
Not a problem.
I just got to swing by Boston
and give my condolences real quick.
BoJack can come with me.
We'll get some work done
while we're there, and then
that way the whole trip won't
be a total waste of time.

TODD: Todd bless these scrambled eggs.Eggs from the fridge.
Sunny side them
And guide them

BOJACK: Todd, stop singing
your dumb scrambled eggs song.

TODD: Who said that?

BOJACK: If you're wondering who said that,
it's this note that you're reading.
You're hearing my voice in your head,
because that's how reading works.

TODD: Oh, yeah.

BOJACK: As you might've noticed,
Todd, I've left you home alone
for the day, and frankly, I
already regret that decision.
Here's what you need to do. Nothing.
Don't touch my stuff,
and don't make a mess.
Pick me up at the airport tomorrow,
and until then, don't do anything.

TODD: Well, seal's broken.
Might as well enjoy myself.
Whee!
Cheers to bath time.
Great story, Todd. I love our friendship.
Here we go!
The great Toddini!
Sorry, dudes, you got the wrong house.
What? 50 bucks?
In that case, come on in, friends.
Some guy named David Boreanaz lives here.

BOJACK: Hey, so listen,
I really want to be here
for you in your time of need,
but I'm not really good
with funerals or death
or families or feelings or people.

DIANE: Don't worry. You can wait in the car.
It's probably better you
don't meet my brothers.
They're narrow-minded,
mean-spirited dirtbags.

BOJACK: I wish I had brothers growing up.
Touch football on the weekends,
noogie parades on the reg.
Life as an only child
can get pretty lonely.
Daddy, do you want to
meet my imaginary friend?
Okay, Daddy.

DIANE: Yeah, well, I was pretty
lonely, too. My family made my
life miserable, and then they
never forgave me for leaving.

BOJACK: So, what, you're like the black sheep?

DIANE: No, Gary's the black sheep.
He's adopted.
I'm just the member of
the family nobody likes.
And my dad was the worst of them all.

BOJACK: You told me that you
and your father used to
sit on the roof and look
at the stars together.

DIANE: Oh, yeah, I was just trying
to get you to open up,
so I used an old writer's
trick called "me lying to you."

BOJACK: Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm using an old me trick
called "that hurts my feelings."

DIANE: And the truth is, I used to
sit alone on the hill out by the
dump and dream of waking up as
Chelsea Clinton, but with my hair.

BOJACK: You do have great hair.

DIANE: I know.
That's us.
I'll just pop in for a quick hi and bye.
Then we'll be on our way.
Ten minutes, swear to God.
You can play with this kaleidoscope
I got you at the airport.

BOJACK: What? A kaleidoscope?
I'm not five...
Shapes and colors the likes
of which I've never seen.

DIANE: Hello.
Marty, it's a game from '86.
You've seen it a hundred times.
100 times.
Gary, Marty, I just got home.
Look, I'm just here to
offer my condolences.
Come on, Ma.
It's the '86 World Series.
They lose.
Well, this was clearly a huge mistake.
Why not? Ma doesn't want me here.
Fine, I'll help.
Is there a number for me to call?
Oh, my God. Is that dad?
Did someone draw balls on his forehead?

TODD: Welcome to the
home of David Boreanaz,
famous from television shows
such as dramas on networks.
That will be $50 please.
Oh, no, no, no, I'll handle
that. Why don't you just
go look through David Boreanaz's
underwear drawer, okay?
It's in his bedroom.

BOJACK: Hey, what do
you think you're doing?

TODD: Uh-oh, am I reading something again?

BOJACK: No, this is your conscience.
BoJack trusted you to
take care of his house.
Is this really... What are you doing?

TODD: It's a great day on Todd's phone.
How can I help you?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Are you trying to cut me out
of this David Boreanaz deal?

TODD: I'm your agent, damn it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: How'd you find out about Boreanaz House?
Don't worry, I'm not just gonna sit here
batting a ball of yarn around
while you do the real work.
I want to take your
project to the next level.
We need to go bigger.
Have you thought about attaching
Mila Kunis to this thing?

TODD: Attach her? How?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You do your job. I'll do mine.

TODD: Who is this?

BOJACK: Ah, out of combinations.
Now I'm bored.
Diaaaaane!

DIANE: I'm just saying Marty could lend a hand
instead of sitting on the
couch watching the game all day.
He didn't get into B.C.
What do you... We're immigrants.
We're Vietnamese?
And that's the same crap you always pull...

BOJACK: Excuse me.
Yes, hello, I'm looking for Diane.
Does anyone here speak English?
Again, does anyone here speak English?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Boreanaz house.
Seventy-five each.
Children and seniors free.

TODD: Please stay behind
the ropes and keep your
hands and belongings on
your person at all times.
Next we'll head to the kitchen where...
Is that Mila Kunis?
Note the letters B.H. on
all hand towels and linens.
That stands for "Boreanaz House."

DIANE: Yeah, do you pick up bodies?
Is that a service you provide?
Corpse removal?

BOJACK: Well, one time at Bristol Farms,
Ben Affleck and I did reach
for the same bunch of grapes.

DIANE: Oh!

BOJACK: Hey, I don't suppose
you boys would have any
interest in maybe playing
some touch football later?
What's that?

DIANE: No, we don't need to revisit that.
Guys, I really would rather not discuss it.

BOJACK: What? That is amazing. Now that's a good prank

DIANE: I was humiliated.

BOJACK: Yeah, you wouldn't get it.
It's a brothers thing, right, brothers?

DIANE: Yep, my therapist thinks the same thing.
I'm gonna go meet with
the funeral director.
Any of you boys want to come?
Fine, none of you have to go.
I'll take care of everything.
Come on, BoJack.

BOJACK: Boys, you have stolen my heart
like Dave Roberts stole second base.
I must go now, but I'll see
you all at the funeral, okay?
And when I do, you're all getting noogies.

TODD: And now, a very special treat
just for our platinum members.
Let's take a peek at the slumbering
Mr. Boreanaz himself.
And thus concludes our tour.
Have a Boreanderful day.

DIANE: Well, he was a mean, sadistic
alcoholic, who never supported
anything I did and actively
delighted in seeing me fail.
That would be too good for my father.
Yeah, that's the one.

BOJACK: Hey, can I suggest something?
You might want to loosen up a little.
I think you could actually
learn a thing or two
from your brothers.

DIANE: Are you kidding?
If I was like my brothers,
nothing would ever get done.

BOJACK: I'm just saying, if you
can't find a way to let off
some steam you're going to explode.
God damn it!
Are you god damn kidding me?
I keep getting calls
from this unlisted number.
Ignore. Who are these assholes?

DIANE: Why don't you just answer,
and then you'll know?

BOJACK: Oh, they'd just love that, wouldn't they?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, let's keep these lines moving, huh?
You want to stop and chat, you gotta
pay for the extended stay ticket.

TODD: Ah, so much, so much, so much.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Another five Gs, T-Bag,
and we are in the pink.

TODD: I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
I ran out of shoeboxes for the money,
and the books aren't adding up.
Plus the men's lav needs
to be serviced, and I had to
fire Janine in the gift shop
for stealing Boreabble heads.
I mean, how did I end up
with all this responsibility?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, I'm not screwing
around here, small fry.
You better make those numbers sing.

TODD: I don't think these offshore
banks we've been using
are 100% legal.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, well, my mother told
me never to slap an idiot.

TODD: What? Ow!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Now we're both breaking the rules.
You listen, and you listen
good. I've gotten used to
a certain lifestyle since
Boreanaz House went public,
and I'm not going back to the old way.
Mommy likes her shoes, see?
And her pearls.

TODD: Oh, I'm in too deep.
I don't know what to do.

BOJACK: I'll tell you what you should do.

TODD: Who said that?

BOJACK: It's me, David Boreanaz.

TODD: Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like?

BOJACK: Uh, sure.
Let me give you some advice.
As we say on my show...
I want to say, New Girl?...
just keep doing what you're
doing, and you'll be fine.

TODD: Wow, thanks, Davie B.

BOJACK: Never call me that!

DIANE: Unbelievable.

BOJACK: It's 4:00. I don't think anyone's coming.

DIANE: Unbe-goddamn-lievable!
All those jerk wads had to do was show up,
and they couldn't even do that!
Where's the body even?
Hey, assholes! Where were you?
I planned the whole funeral,
like you asked me to,
and nobody showed.
Wait, what? Where is Dad?
You chummed Dad?
Let me get this straight.
So instead of coming to the funeral
that I paid for and
spent all day organizing,
you had Dad's body ground into chum,
so you could throw his
mushy remains on Derek Jeter?
Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.
I don't think I'm too good for my home.

BOJACK: Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong.
Diane isn't a big-shot.
She's my ghostwriter.
She's writing a book that's not
even gonna have her name on it.
You think this is how she expected
her life would be going at 34?
She lives with her rich
boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.
She's not too good for anything.
BoJack helping?
Whoa.

DIANE: This is why I told you to wait in the car!

DIANE: Suck a dick, dumb shits!

BOJACK: So what we're gonna do is nothing?
Does anyone know where
she might have gone?
I think I know where she went.
I don't know, Diane was pretty upset,
and she's got your dad.
I... Really?
Ah, um...

TODD: Oh, this isn't looking
good, Princess Carolyn.
What are we gonna do?

PRINCESS CAROLYN:What do you mean, we? Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.
Ha!

TODD: Um, would you like a Boreabble head?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The amazing thing is, the house
looks just like BoJack's house.
They must have the same architect.
Anyway, how are things with you?

DIANE: Not good.
I should've known it was a
waste of time to come back here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, that's awful.
Well, when you get back,
I'll give you one of my
patented Peanutbutter hugs.
Crunchy and creamy.
You know that patent wasn't
approved, but I'll take it.

DIANE: I have to go. BoJack's here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack, well, what's he doing...?

BOJACK: Hey.
Sorry I said all that stuff about you.

DIANE: It's all true, isn't it?

BOJACK: I found this letter back at the bar.
I think it's for you.
Look, just read it.
I think you'll like it.

DIANE: "Dear Diane, it's me, your old pen pal Leo.
This definitely isn't BoJack
Horseman writing this."

BOJACK: Keep reading.

DIANE: "You're a good person, Diane,
and that's the most important thing.
Even if no one appreciates you,
it's important that you
don't stop being good.
I like how you always bring your
own bags to the grocery store,
and how you're always
organized to go places.
I like how you chew gum on the
airplane so your ears will pop.
A lot of people might not
appreciate that about you,
but I do.
Yours forever, Leo."
That's the best letter he ever wrote me.

BOJACK: Look, take it from someone
with his own shitty parents,
family is a sinkhole,
and you were right to get
out when you had the chance.

DIANE: The stupid thing is,
even now I still just want
them to be proud of me
and think I did good.
Is that really stupid?

BOJACK: Yep.

DIANE: No, it isn't.

BOJACK: Yeah, it is. You want those guys to be proud of you?

DIANE: I guess I was just hoping to
get some modicum of closure.

BOJACK: Closure is a made up thing
by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.
It, like true love and the Munich Olympics,
doesn't exist in the real world.
The only thing to do now is
just to keep living forward.

DIANE: Yeah, but every time
I come back here they...

BOJACK: So don't come back here.
What's great about Los Angeles
is nobody cares about where
you're from or who you are.
It's a superficial town
where you can worry about stupid shit
like keeping your pool clean,
and what artisanal nuts
to put on your salad.

DIANE: I do like salad.

BOJACK: Oh, it's the best.
Why do you think people keep moving there? 

DIANE: Thanks, BoJack.

BOJACK: The good news is, your dad
can't hurt anyone ever again.
Uh-oh. Um, I'll meet you inside.
I have to make a call.

DIANE: Okay.

BOJACK: Hey, Herb, look, I think we
have some unfinished business.
It seems like life's
too short to hold grudges
and stuff like that,
you know what I'm saying?
About life being too short?
Well, of course you know what I'm saying.
You're the one with terminal...
I feel like I'm doing all the talking here.
So anyway, I thought maybe we could chat.
Why don't you give me a call, okay?
Um... so smell you later?
This is BoJack. Horseman.
Obviously.

TODD: Come on, BoJack.
Pick up, pick up.
I'm sure he'll pick up.

BOJACK: It's BoJack. You know what to do.
