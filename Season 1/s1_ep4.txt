BOJACK: And he says... he says, "Why the long face?" And I say, "Hey, buddy, I can't help it." You get that? Long face. Horses have long faces.
I am a horse, my face is long. You get it, right? Good, good. What about the Rock Hudson stuff? Felt like that flew over your heads.Did you get that? Okay, okay, it wasn't that funny. Uh, hey, guys, guys... Get cancer, jerk wad. But then who do I know if they got it? Why are you giving me advice?  Oh, I don't drink. BoJack Horseman. Oh, God! Goddamn it, Todd, clean up your shit.

TODD: What am I supposed to do, okay? You don't give me any closet space.

BOJACK: Not my problem. A better man than you once said, and I quote, "It's the responsibility
of little guys like you to be looking out for big shots like me."

TODD: Who said that?

BOJACK: I don't know, Jesus, Ghandi, Malcolm-Jamal Warner. Clean up your shit! Oh!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, BoJack, settle a bet. Are you a Zoe or a Zelda?

BOJACK: Don't know what that means.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, I was talking to Wayne.

BOJACK: Who's Wayne?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wayne's writing an article about me for BuzzFeed. BuzzFeed? What'll they think of next?

DIANE: Fun fact: Wayne is also my ex-boyfriend.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Pretty cool, eh, BoJack? Diane's writing a book about you, Wayne's writing an article about me.
We're the same!

BOJACK: How could you think that that's the same? My book will be in libraries for hundreds of years. Your BuzzFeed article will be crammed
between an animated GIF of a cat falling asleep and a list of fun facts about Legally Blonde.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ha! Classic Zoe.

BOJACK: I still don't know what that means.

BOJACK: Do you mean his sitcom that coincidentally had the exact same premise as my sitcom?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Pretty smile, Zelly-belly. Why don't I keep the knife, Zo-bo? N-n-no?

TODD: So Zooey's a Zoe? What a crazy world.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So which one are you, BoJack?

BOJACK: I think I'm... above this.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Said the Zoe.

TODD: Well, I think I'm a Zelda.

BOJACK: Or maybe you're the third kind of person, whose only function is to drain the energy and life force from his host organism.

DIANE: Come on, BoJack.

TODD: Nah, he's right. I'm pretty much worthless.

BOJACK: See? You say something to someone enough times, and eventually, he internalizes it. The system works.

TODD:  I don't have a job, I
don't have any prospects. I probably won't ever finish the rock opera I'm working on.

BOJACK: What? Since when are you working on a rock opera? Oh, no. Why'd I ask that?

TODD: Basically, it's Tommy by
way of Cirque du Soleil set in space, with heavy erotic overtones,
and the gripping psychodrama of a thriller
with plenty of heart and more than a little humor.
I call it Newtopia Rising, Book 1: The Search for a New Utopia.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Book 1? You've got me thinking sequel here. 

TODD: Traveling on a spaceship. 

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I’m in.

BOJACK: I'm out.

TODD: So far away from home. To find a new and better place. A planet rich with loam.

BOJACK: Loam? "Rich with loam?"

TODD: Yeah, it's a kind of soil. These people are simple,
agricultural types.

BOJACK: On a spaceship?

TODD: We learned a lot.
And had some laughs. But they couldn't make us slaves. No! No, they couldn't
make us slaves. No! No, they could-n-n-n’t. Make u-u-u-us. One, two

BOJACK: ”Slaves." Just say "slaves."

TODD: Sla-a-a-a-a-a-aves. 

BOJACK: That was... and I don't say this lightly... worse than a hundred September 11ths.

TODD: Yeah, you're right.
This was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking. Well, guess I'll give up forever.

BOJACK: That's the spirit. Now, you have to understand
that as a port city, Liverpool had unique access to
all aspects of American culture, especially Blues music and its
unruly nephew, Rock and Roll.

DIANE: I thought this story was about
running into Paul McCartney in the bathroom at the Golden Globes.

BOJACK: It is. I thought you would
appreciate some context.

DIANE: Let's skip that one for a minute.
Tell me about Todd.

BOJACK: Todd? What's to tell?
Five years ago, he found his way into
one of my house parties and never left.

DIANE: And you've never asked
him anything about himself?

BOJACK: I’ve asked him to get a job,
I've asked him to move out.

DIANE: With a little encouragement,
I'll bet he could really flourish.
I mean, didn't you have
anyone who helped you
when you were just starting out?

BOJACK: Um, actually, no.

DIANE: Todd clearly thinks the world of you.

BOJACK: Todd thinks the world of Pop-Tarts.

DIANE: Look, I get that helping other
people is not your thing, but...

BOJACK: What? I let Todd live
rent-free in my stately manse.
I am his own personal Mother Teresa.

DIANE: But do you let him stay
here because you're kind
or just because you're
terrified of being alone?

BOJACK: That is insane!
I would love to be alone.
That is all I want.

DIANE: Mmm... if that were really true,
I don't think you'd be clipping
Todd's wings all the time.

BOJACK: What? That's unbelievable. Todd!

TODD: What? Clean up my shit?

BOJACK: Yes, but also, I would like to...
help you with your dumb-ass rock opera.

TODD: What?

BOJACK: I am... supporting you.

TODD: I-I don't understand.
Oh, my God, are you dying?

BOJACK: No. I... think you have
great depth of untapped
potential and I wish to
mentor you in your... art.

TODD: Really?

BOJACK: Yes.

TODD: Wait, is this going to be like that time
you promised to take me ice skating,
and I got really excited
about the ice skating,
but then instead of ice
skating, you left me at home
so you could go to the strip club
and then you took the
strippers ice skating?

BOJACK: No.

TODD: Then hooray!

BOJACK: Let's dig in. Where to start?
Okay, well, the headline is, I hate it.
I hate everything about it.
The premise is bad and
the execution is also bad.
It's an irredeemable jumble of shit.

TODD: Tough but fair.

DIANE: Ahem.

BOJACK: That said, I don't see why we can't
make something really great here.

TODD: Okay, thank you. I'll work on that.

BOJACK: Are you close?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No!

BOJACK: How 'bout now?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No!

BOJACK: Now?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're not even inside of me.

BOJACK: Oh, God! Did you get there?

TODD: Okay, so you know in the
second act closer when the
seekers of Newtopia are
in the Turbidians' dungeon
and they learn their ship has been destroyed?

BOJACK: No.

TODD: Well, what if we move
that to the fourth act?

BOJACK: I have no idea what you're talking
about, but that idea is terrible.

TODD: I hear the note.
Let me see what I can do. And that's why this planet Su-u-u-u-u-cks So?

BOJACK: How can I put this?
Imagine if the Holocaust happened
every four years like the Olympics.
I would rather that happened
than your rock opera.

TODD: That's not really a note.
In fact, none of your
notes have been notes.
I feel like you're not even listening.

BOJACK: Yeah, well, you know what?
Maybe I would listen
if the Turbidians had some reason
to enter the Cave of Swollen Dreams that
didn't break the pact
they made in act one with Queen Darneesa.

TODD: You have been listening.

BOJACK: This just doesn't make sense.
The Turbidians are a loyal people.
They... they wouldn't
betray their queen. Unless...

BOJACK: Well, don't just sit there!
Get this down! Oh, you like that. You like daddy's good stuff?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Not especially.

BOJACK: Did you get there?

TODD: Okay, what if there isn't a robot army?

BOJACK: I think you just blew this thing wide open.

TODD: We'll make this
our Newtopia-a-a 

BOJACK: Up a fifth 

TODD:  Ah 

BOJACK: Down a fifth 

TODD:  A-a-ah 

BOJACK: That was great!
This train is moving.
Let's take a break and get lunch.

TODD: Wait, you want to get lunch with me?

BOJACK: Yeah, that's right.

TODD: Is this like the time
you invited me to lunch,
but then, when I got to the restaurant,
you texted me to tell me you weren't coming
because you were at a strip
club "eating stripper" for lunch, and also, it was my birthday?

BOJACK: No.

TODD: Then hooray!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And that was a last time I
worked with David O. Russell.
What's that old expression?
"Fool me once, shame on
me, but fool me twice...
fiddle-dee-dee."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ooh, hold on.
I gotta take this. Erica, I don't have time to be charmed to death right now.

DIANE: Better question: How long does it
take to write a BuzzFeed article? 

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What?!
Diane, Diane, Diane, Diane! Do you know what today is?

DIANE: Sunday?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's "burritos as big as your
head" day at El Taco Loco!
We gotta go right now!

DIANE: I thought we were going
to see the Diane Arbus show
at LACMA today. You
know I love Diane Arbus.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I see what's happening here.
Her name is Diane,
and your name is Diane.

DIANE: That's not what's happening.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What? Oh, man, you guys are
perfect for each other. Why did you ever break up? Okay, less yakking, more snacking.
Let's go ride in the car!

BOJACK: You mean to tell me that for
a full year you were on the run
 from the Russian mafia?

TODD: Well, a Russian mafia.

BOJACK: I can't believe you never
told me any of this stuff.
I just thought you
were a dumb freeloader
who ate all my food and
played video games all day.

TODD: You should have seen me in high school. There was this one game, Decapathon.

BOJACK: I remember that game. I was up for Dr. Decapitator
in the movie version. They said they wanted someone hipper, but the part ended up
going to Robert Downey.

TODD: Junior?

BOJACK: If it was Junior,
I would have said, "Junior."

TODD: That game basically destroyed my life. I flunked out of school,
my girlfriend left me. I mean, I didn't stop playing until my mom threw me out of the house. I mean, that's when I
first realized, you know, I'm a total screw-up.

BOJACK: You're not a screw-up anymore, Todd.
You're about to have a hit
rock opera on your hands.

TODD: I’m really glad you think that. I got Princess Carolyn
to invite Virgil Van Cleef to our next rehearsal.

BOJACK: Who in the what Van?

TODD: Virgil Van Cleef is the
biggest name in rock opera.
Okay, think of all the great rock operas
from the last 20 years.

BOJACK: Okay.

TODD: He had a piece of all of them.

BOJACK: Wow, Todd, are you sure
we're ready for that?

TODD: Hey, you said yourself the train is moving,
but if you think we're not ready,
I mean, I'll listen to you.

BOJACK: Hey, you've done enough listening, buddy.
Maybe it's about time I start listening.

TODD: Well, I feel like...

BOJACK: Gotta take this. Hello?
Hello?
BoJack Horseman?
I am very happy with my current long distance provider, thank you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
having lunch with my friend.
All right, gang, when Virgil
Van Cleef gets here, look alive.
This could be Todd's big break,
so clap really hard and
laugh at all the jokes,
even if they're not funny,
but also, be careful,
because a lot of things
you might think are jokes
are not jokes,
so, you know, look out. That was not a joke.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That was not a real laugh.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I hope you don't mind
I brought Wayne along.

BOJACK: Who's Wayne?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I just wanted to make sure
he had everything he needs
for the big BuzzFeed cover story.

BOJACK: BuzzFeed is a website.
There is no cover.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Eh, "tomato," "tomato."

BOJACK: It's "tomato," "to-mah-to."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You say, "tomato," "to-mah-to,"
I say, "tomato," "tomato."
Oh, hey, Diane, I got you something.

DIANE: Oh, plane tickets?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER:  Yep, to San Francisco.
That's where the Arbus
exhibit is heading next.

DIANE: Oh, my God.
Thanks, Mr. Peanutbutter.


BOJACK: What you're about to
see is rough, very rough.
It's a vomit pass at what
might become a rock opera.
Right now, it's set mostly in space,
but we're not married to that.
Todd is neither a singer
nor a trained musician.
In fact, he never even
graduated high school,
he told me in confidence.
Keep all that in mind as
you give it up for Todd.

TODD: Okay, so we start in 1887
with a young Emma Goldman. No they couldn-n-n-n't
make u-u-u-us. Sla-a-a-a-a-aves 

BOJACK: I had the same note.

TODD: Six weeks? Uh, damn. Yeah, I guess so.

DIANE: You know, just when you think
you have a person pegged,
he can still find ways to surprise you.

BOJACK: Yeah, Todd really rose to
the occasion, didn't he?

DIANE: I was talking about you.

BOJACK: Ah, well, it was nothing.

DIANE: Maybe the Zoe has a little
Zelda in him after all.

BOJACK: I appreciate the sentiment,
but I still think that game is stupid.

TODD: Hey, BoJack, do you
realize what this means?
I mean, if this thing's a
hit, I could finally move out.

BOJACK: Oh, uh, you're gonna move out?

TODD: You won't have to yell, "Hey,
Todd, clean up your shit!"
Or, "Todd, why haven't you
cleaned up your shit yet?"
Or, "Todd, what was the name of
that guy from Perfect Strangers?
Not Bronson Pinchot,
but the other one?"

BOJACK: Good, that's great.
That's great and good.
So good, so great. Just great, and also good.

TODD: Mm-hmm.

BOJACK: This is all just happening so fast.
Todd is ready for this.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Todd's not ready or you're not ready?

BOJACK: Don't make this about me.
I've seen what happens
when baby birds get pushed
out of the nest too soon.
It's not your fault.
It's not... your... fault.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're right. In these heady times,
what Todd needs is an agent.
Todd can do it!
Todd can do anything!
Can I get your autograph?

TODD: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: And another autograph,
and initial here, here, here, and here.

TODD: Right here?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: And the last four digits of your social.

TODD: Okay.
So I think the big third
act number Virgil wants might be a big anthem that...

BOJACK: Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy,
I'm not gonna let you start
on this until we stock up
on snacks and Red Bull.

TODD: I do get snacky.
You think of everything.
Sure thing, lady.
Oh, my God. Decapathon VII?
This just came out.

BOJACK: Todd, put it down.

TODD: Is this really only a dime?

BOJACK: Todd, this is no time for a relapse.

TODD: Look, okay, I'll buy it
now, but I won't play it
till after I've written the new song.

BOJACK: Todd, this is a bad idea!

TODD: Whoa!
Okay, let's see here.
I wonder if it still smells the same.

BOJACK: I assure you, it still smells
like cheap plastic and child labor.

TODD: Okay, here we go. Song time.
Or should I just play one game now,
just to get the creative juices flowing?

BOJACK: We both know that if you
play that game tonight, you'll never leave this couch!

TODD: Ah, no, you're right, of course. Thank you.

BOJACK: Good night.

TODD: Come on, Decapathon, come on. Oh, come on, Decapathon. Oh.

BOJACK: Damn it, Todd, the investor
showcase is in half an hour. Did you work on the song?

TODD: Huh?

BOJACK: Pull yourself together, man!

TODD: Ugh! Why did the water have
to come out of your mouth?

BOJACK: Wait! Give the kid a chance, Van Cleef.

TODD: Loam, loam, loam. And a... uh, little
room to, uh, roam. And on this planet
It's our home. In space. Loam.

BOJACK: Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready
for the high-flying world of rock opera
or the larger world outside
of my living room couch,
but you know what?
He's a good friend.
No, of course you don't.
Maybe Todd's worse off today,
but you're worse off in
the long run, because you're
gonna die alone and unloved,
you pompous, affected asshole!

TODD: Hey, maybe don't burn the bridge. I could still beg for a second chance.

BOJACK: Shut your mouth, Todd. And you shut yours, Van Cleef,
or I will buck it shut. Suck a dick, dumb shits! Oh, that damn video game.

TODD: No, it's not the video game's fault.
I blew it.
For a second, I actually convinced myself
I was more than just a worthless screw-up.
Fool me once, fool me twice,
fool me chicken soup with rice.

BOJACK: I guess there's a reason they
don't call it "the rock opera fun."
They call it "the rock opera business."

TODD: Guess I won't be needing
this piece of junk anymore.

454
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,062
BOJACK: Hey, no. Hold on to that.
Why don't you just put it
in the living room closet?

TODD: Really?

BOJACK: In fact, from now on,
you can keep all your stuff
in the living room closet.

TODD: Thanks, BoJack, for everything.
BOJACK: This, I will get rid of.

DIANE: What the... Are these the notes
you've been taking on
Mr. Peanutbutter? It's gibberish!
Have you just been mashing
keys this whole time?
What's really going on here?
No, I've dated you.
Sure, you're smart and
sophisticated and cool,
but you're also mean.
What's your article on
Mr. Peanutbutter called?
 I knew it!
I'm not "tearing him apart."
I'm writing a nuanced
portrait of a complicated man.
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to me!
He's kind and he's generous
and he's loyal.
Don't label me.
You don't know who I am.

BOJACK: Yeah, I bought this earlier,
and I'd like to return it.
I don't know where the receipt went.
Thanks for your help, character
actress Margo Martindale.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This never happened.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I like that guy.
