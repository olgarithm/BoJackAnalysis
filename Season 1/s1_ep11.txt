BOJACK: Okay, how about this one?
BoJack swallowed a dozen
pastries in the time it took
the caterer to unwrap a fruit tray.
When she asked where the pastries had gone,
BoJack claimed he had no idea,
spraying her with bits of buttery crust?

DIANE: See? People respond
to the flawed portrait I painted of you.
They see themselves in it.
Why do you love Secretariat?

BOJACK: Because he was awesome?

DIANE: No, because he was flawed.
BoJack, when people find
out that someone like you,
who seems larger than life,
is actually just as wounded
and vulnerable as they are,
it makes them feel less lonely.

BOJACK: No! Maybe that's what flawed,
sad fatties want from other celebrities,
but for BoJack Horseman,
they want a heroic
horse-stud who is awesome
and who can save them from
their flawed, sad, fatty lives.

DIANE: You're so wrong.

BOJACK: Actually, you know what?
Now that I think about it,
I think that you're so wrong!
The end of the week? No!

BOJACK: Okay, what if I told you that I could have
a new book for you by then?

DIANE: What?

BOJACK: Yeah, a better one.
Better stories, better told, by me...
straight from the horse's mouth.

DIANE: You're gonna write a
whole book in five days?
When's the last time you even read a book?
The Firm, by John Grisham?

BOJACK: Do you think what you do is so hard?
"I'm a writer.
I go to coffee shops with
my laptop and my notebook
and my dumb glasses that I have to wear,
because I'm so important
I need to see clearly."

DIANE: Well, I wish you the best of luck.

BOJACK: You know what your problem is?
You think you're so much
smarter than everybody.
Well, guess what.
I spent as much time with
you as you did with me.
Why don't I write a book about
how you married Mr. Peanutbutter
because he's too dumb to see how
much better you think you are?

DIANE: Okay, I know you're upset...

BOJACK: I'm not upset.
I'm just sick of nerd-girls like
you beating up on stars like me.
It's pathetic! I'm sorry no one wanted
to date you in high school, Diane,
but I don't see why I
have to suffer just because
you were never especially
pretty or interesting.

DIANE: You really let me down, BoJack.

BOJACK: You really let me down.
I apologize for her outbursts.
Damn right I can, so you
can throw this turd of a book
in the garbage and then
light the garbage on fire.
In fact, you can burn all
books, because my book,
written by me, is gonna kick your dick off.
Okay, chapter one.
Not quite right.
What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Why are you rewriting the book, bozo?
Diane's version is great.
You're gonna lose gems like this one...
Ahem. "The only longstanding relationship
in BoJack's life is with
his agent, Princess Carolyn.
Her loyalty must come
from a deep-rooted faith
that she's talented enough
to sustain the career of a man
society perceives as a joke."

BOJACK: Yeah, I would say that
I'm not such a fan of that one.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Look, all publicity is good publicity.
That guy who killed all those
teachers and ate their fingers?
He just got married in jail,
and when this book comes out,
you could be that guy.

BOJACK: Don't you get it?
This is my last chance to
make people love me again.
If this goes out, everybody's
gonna see the real me.
Now, I spend a lot of
time with the real me,
and believe me, nobody's
gonna love that guy.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay.

BOJACK: Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to go take a shower
so I can't tell if I'm crying or not.
All right, let's get to work.
I feel like we can beat this font.
Copperplate, a font
for the truly modern man.
Ha. No.
There you are, Verdana.
Thought you could hide at the
end of the alphabet, did ya?
Comic Sans, you drunk, go home.
3:10? I just spent six hours
playing with fonts? Holy shit!
Okay, focus BoJack, focus.
Here comes the focus.
Well, this can't be that hard.

DIANE: BoJack often felt the need
to impress me with material items.

BOJACK: You can see from the
teeny, tiny brush strokes,
that this is very expensive.
The color is, um... This one
they don't even have a name for,
that's how exclusive it is, and this...

DIANE: I wondered where this came from.
There were two obvious suspects.
His mother Beatrice,
heiress to the Sugarman Sugar Cubes fortune
and used to certain comforts,
and his working-class
father, Butterscotch Horseman,
who struggled, and often failed,
to provide those comforts.
Or, maybe it was something even...

BOJACK: Hey, Todd, Todd!

TODD: What? What?

BOJACK: Todd! Todd!

TODD: What? What?

BOJACK: Eyeballs here... Look at me. Look at me!
I need to work. I can't
afford to be distracted.
Don't distract me.

TODD: Fine.

BOJACK: Jesus, Todd!
Read louder much?

TODD: Sorry.

BOJACK: Sure, just drop Toaster Strudel crumbs
all over the floor, why don't you?
Guess I'll just clean them
up myself, like always.
I can't work like this.
Come on, come on, come on,
pick it up, you dumb vacuum.
I do not have time for this.
I need to write.
What the... Come on!
Seriously? You cannot be seriou...
God, why are you keeping me from writing?
My parents loved me so much, it was crazy.
I remember one Sunday
afternoon, my mother said,
"Your father and I want to spend
quality family time together.
All the kids in school
envy your intelligence
and kickball ability.
Here's an ice cream sundae."
No, wait.
"An ice cream sandwich."
No.
"A dreamsicle."
No. I don't know. This is dumb.
What did I do?
Just need something to help me focus.
Coffee.
No, no. Cigarettes.
No, tequila!
No, I just need the right music...
to do drugs to.
Sarah Lynn, I know things
got kind of out of hand
last time when I tried to
make you stop doing drugs.
So I just want to thank you
for coming over this time
to give me drugs.
These are gonna help me focus
and get work done, right?

TODD: That's exactly what he needs.
Also, I should probably do another one.

BOJACK: It's "Hu." Dr. Hu.
No, no, no, but I thought it
was "Who," like Doctor Who.
No, not H-U, but, "who,"
like, "Hello, who is it?"
Seriously? Am I the only one
who knows the extremely popular
BBC science fiction show
about the time traveling doctor
who saves civilizations?

TODD: Yeah.
I know what you're talking
about... Doctor Who.

BOJACK: No.
Yes, thank you. Doctor Who.

TODD: I saw the one where she
goes to the Wild West.
The Cheyenne called her Medicine Woman.

BOJACK: What? No, that's Dr. Quinn.

TODD: Who's Dr. Quinn?
I don't know.

BOJACK: When are these drugs going to kick in?
So... Gremlin rules?
All right, team, focus up.
We got a book to write.

TODD: Yeah, yeah. My God, this is so good.

BOJACK: Okay, Todd, how is it going
with the heartwarming anecdotes?

TODD: Great! I'm writing about that time
we officially became best friends.

BOJACK: Nice! Can you change best to pretty good?
Sarah Lynn, how's it coming
with the Horsin' Around years?
Great. Keep typing, monkeys.
If only Hulk Hogan could see us now, right?

TODD: What?

BOJACK: Because Sarah Lynn said
the thing about Hulk Hogan?
Right.
How we doing now?

TODD: Just about to send.

BOJACK: Nice.
Okay, this is great.
That puts us at 216 pages?
Holy shit, that's almost as
long as The Firm by John Grisham.

TODD: And we just needed to get to 200, right?

BOJACK: It's surprisingly literate
and insightful, but still fun.
It's a beach read you can
thumb through in a wing chair.
Can't believe Diane
thought this was so hard.
"My fingers are cramping
from all this typing.
It's like they're having their period."

TODD: Did Diane really say that?

BOJACK: No, but my fingers are cramping.
It's like they're having
their period, am I right?
Are you just laughing
so I'll leave you alone?

BOJACK: We just need a way to end this thing.
What should the ending be?

TODD: Maybe it was Earth all along.

BOJACK: Not that, but something like that.
Keep thinking.
I got it!
Did you guys switch clothes?

TODD: No.

BOJACK: What...
What?

TODD: Your idea for the ending.

BOJACK: What'd I say?

TODD: About Maine.
About how you end up in Maine.

BOJACK: Yeah, right, and when I get
too old to take care of myself,
I go for one last swim.
I know I can't make it back to shore.
I'm too weak, too tired.
So I just let the water take me under.

TODD: Eesh! Downer ending.

BOJACK: You got something better?

TODD: Yeah, I mean, if you want to, like, finish
finish the book, then you'd
have to, like, die tonight.

BOJACK: I love it. It's perfect.
We'll sell so many books.

TODD: Yeah. Yeah, kill BoJack!
Yes!
There it is! Yeah, gonna get you!

BOJACK: No, no, no, no...
Okay, so what did we learn?
We learned that if we're going to do drugs
we should do them at home where
it's safe to do them together,
right, Todd?

TODD: No!

BOJACK: Don't worry, guys.
I have this gun to keep
us safe from intruders.
And each other.

TODD: Wait, wait, wait.
Is that just your gun-shaped lighter,
or your lighter-shaped gun?

BOJACK: Busted! It's just a lighter.
Shit, I guess it's my gun.
Then what'd I do with my lighter?
And what did I give to that baby?

TODD: Ha, I have a gun, too.

BOJACK: Don't be a Silly Billy. That's a broom.
Wait, am I holding a gun?
Todd, are you holding a gun or a broom?

TODD: I can't tell anymore!

BOJACK: I guess we'll just have
to shoot them at each other
at the same time to find out!

TODD: Okay!

BOJACK: Todd, sh... Can I just
say... Todd, Todd, I need you...
I need you to shh. Listen, listen, Todd.
Okay, just to be totally
clear, we're shooting each other
to determine whether we're
holding guns or brooms, right?
Not because you're
still mad about the whole
me sabotaging you with the rock opera
and your live stream and suchety-such?

TODD: BoJack, shh, shh, okay, Bo?
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
As you know, I was hurt,
but then I realized
that's just how you are.
You know, and maybe I just
need to stop expecting you
to be a good person,
so that way, I won't
get hurt when you're not.

BOJACK: O... Okay.
Sarah Lynn is right.
You know, if we all had guns,
then no one would need a gun,
and we would all be safe.
My God.
I think we just solved
the gun crisis in America.

TODD: Let them eat guns!
Bang, bang, pow, pow, yeah, wow!

TODD: Now we just have to solve
the drug crisis in America.

BOJACK: Easy! We'll take them all.

TODD: Yes!

DIANE: BoJack?
Hey, sorry. You okay?

BOJACK: Yeah...

DIANE: Listen, I've thought
about it, and you're right.
Your memoir should be
a representation of you.
It's only fair you're happy
with how you're portrayed.

BOJACK: Really?

DIANE: Yeah.
And I want to help write a
book we can both be proud of.

BOJACK: My God. Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you okay?

DIANE: No!
Not this again!

BOJACK: What is happening!

DIANE: I ate too many pancakes!

BOJACK: Shit, I'm still tripping.

DIANE: Kiss me.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm Mr. Peanut... I'm Mr. Peanut...
I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

BOJACK: What?
Whoa.
What the...
Whoa! Okay, stay calm.
I don't have outlines anymore. That's okay.
There's no boundary between me and space.
This is a thing that happens.
Shouldn't we help him?

DIANE: No, he loves treading water.

BOJACK: God.
My God. My God. My God.
Why is everyone laughing? What's so funny?
This is all I am and all I'll ever be.
What is it?
What?
No, no.

TODD: No?
Well, isn't it too late to say no, BoJack?
This is the road you chose.

BOJACK: I'm sinking, somebody help.
The floor is tar.
I can't, I'm stuck.
Do they have Pinkberry in Maine?
I can't!
I can't.
But I don't feel like singing.
No.

DIANE: Hey.
What seems to be the problem?

BOJACK: Good grief. I'm so depressed.
I just want everyone to love me,
but I don't know how to make them do it.

DIANE: You can't force love, you blockhead.
All you can do is be good
to the people in your life,
and keep your heart open.

BOJACK: I screwed it all up.
It's too late for me, isn't it?

DIANE: I don't know.
I'm just a crazy drug hallucination.
I'll say whatever you want me to.

BOJACK: Then tell me it's not too late.

DIANE: Well, it's not too late.
It's never too late.

BOJACK: Yeah, that's right.

DIANE: It's never too late
to be the person you want to be.
You need to choose the life you want.
That'll be 5 cents please...

BOJACK: Yes, dear?
Ran into Ed at the hardware store.
He said we're in for some weather.
What the hell does that
mean? "Some weather."
We're always in for some weather.
Guess what, Ed? There's never not weather.
Come on, I can't help it.
It's just so cute how
they do it automatically.
How do they know?
Oh man, can we just stay exactly like this
for the rest of our lives, please?
What? That's amazing.
Is it weird that I want to
make love to you right now?
I don't know, it's... I
don't want to spook the baby.
Maybe we should just
do mouth and hand stuff
for the next nine months.
Oh I think someone's awake.
Yes, Gooby Girl, Dada's coming.
I'm gonna eat your finger.
Yum, yum, num, num.
Harper?
They're still there.
We just can't see them
because the sun is shining.
Harper?
Well, that depends.
Do you love cookies, and
the color green, and braids?
Well, then, your application
has been submitted
and is pending board approval.
Approved!
She grew up so fast.
Honey, a Vespa is not a motorcycle.
What are you thinking about?
Oh... What? Where?
Hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, I read the pages
you sent me last night,
and I have to tell you,
your book is absolutely,
without a doubt, the most...
gibberish.
It's gibberish.

BOJACK: What day is it?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Let's see what you got here.
You got 20 pages of Doctor
Who erotic fan fiction,
a recipe for soup, five different theories
about how 9/11 happened,
and a bunch of embedded YouTube videos
that can't possibly be
printed in book form.

BOJACK: Okay, I gotta go.
Yeah, I got a question.
My question is for Diane.
Look, I'm sorry about all the
stuff I said about you earlier.
We can publish the book you wrote.
You're obviously a better writer than I am,
and I don't actually even really care
what the world thinks about me anymore.
I just hated reading that book
because I hated feeling
like that's how you saw me.
Because I guess you know
me better than anybody,
and if you think that...
Um, I guess my question is, do you...
Do you think it's too late for me?

DIANE: What?

BOJACK: I mean, am I just doomed
to be the person that I am?

DIANE: The... The person in that book?

BOJACK: It's not too late for me, is
it? It's... It's not too late...
Diane, I need you to tell
me that it's not too late.

DIANE: BoJack, I...

BOJACK: I... I need you to tell me
that I'm a good person.
I know that I can be
selfish and narcissistic
and self-destructive,
but underneath all that,
deep down, I'm a good person,
and I need you to tell
me that I'm good, Diane.
Tell me, please, Diane.
Tell me that I'm good.
