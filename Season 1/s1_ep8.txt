BOJACK: Oh, right.
Well, just tell whoever, then.
Anyway, I'm off to
Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.
He has cancer, which, as
you know, is a whole thing.
Plus, he hates me, so I could really use
some good news at the end of the day.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, my God. You're going to see Herb?
You must be really... Nope.
Don't care. Not interested.

BOJACK: Okay, Good talk.

DIANE: Hey.
Ready for this?

BOJACK: Listen.
I want to make sure I don't spend
any time alone with Herb.
I'm bringing you along as my buffer.

DIANE: And your memoirist.
I should meet your old best friend
before he dies of cancer.

BOJACK: Fine, I guess.
Just don't abandon me.
No bathroom breaks.
And don't slip out of the room
to text your fianc√© a
bunch of winky smileys
with hearts next to them... Gross.
Congratulations on the
whole being engaged thing,
by the way.

DIANE: Thanks.
It's just starting to hit me.
I'm getting married.
Thank God I don't have to die alone.
No offense.

BOJACK: None taken.
Till you said, "No offense."

DIANE: So what's the deal with you and this guy?
You never talk about him.

BOJACK: Well, I kind of, maybe
stabbed him in the back.
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.
A story of power, betrayal,
and ambitious hairstyles.
The year? 198...

TODD: Movie's over.

BOJACK: Watch the next one.

TODD: Aw, I'm tired of watching movies.
Do you want to play a game?

BOJACK: Sure.
I spy with my little eye someone who needs
to shut the hell up.

TODD: Is it me?

BOJACK: It's always you.
Now, where was I?

DIANE: You were about to tell
a story about you being a shitty friend,
but then, we got interrupted
by you yelling at Todd.

BOJACK: Oh, yeah. Shut up, Todd.

BOJACK:
Thanks, Charlotte, but
one beer gets me tipsy.
I got to be clear-headed for my set.
Looks like Herb's killing.
Wow. They must be serious about Herb.
That's Angela Diaz.
She's the woman who made pantsuits a thing.
I'm in.
That movie was amazing,
except for all the lame time period jokes.
We get it. The '50s were different.
I'll have a New Coke, please.
Listen, you guys don't need
to include me on your dates.
Sometimes, it makes me
feel like a third wheel.
Wouldn't that make it a bicycle?
Great set, man.
It's like everything you said was something
I've thought before but
never had the balls to say.
Well, thank you, Bubbles.
I love L.A. Don't you guys?
The prettiest girls in the
world flock to this city,
and they end up with total knobs.
Take this couple, for example.
Excuse me, miss. Is that your date?
That's your husband? You can do better.
Give me a call after the show.
I'm just kidding around.
I'm not kidding around.
Ugh.
Maker's Manhattan? 2:00 P.M.?
Not judging.
That guy tipped me a quarter.
That's barely enough money
to buy three gallons of gas.
No, I got to stay sharp.
I got another audition this afternoon.
God, I can't wait till I'm finally up
for real jobs instead of
these dumb commercials.
"Here's the thing about
most long-distance plans."
It's so stupid.
I don't expect to be offered Secretariat
right away, but when am I gonna be up
for real roles?
Wait.
Did the guys from ABC call?
An off-the-clock,
non-work-related social event?
That's the perfect time to pitch a TV show.
You're brilliant.
Guys, don't take your eyes off the prize.
We need to fill Charlotte's
bag with these mini quiches.
This is our breakfast for June.
Shit, we're busted.
Pretend you don't speak English.
Salutations. Crap, that's English.
Well, there he goes.
Herb's about to hit the big time,
and I'm just gonna be a small-fry
doing tiny commercials
and eating mini quiches.
He does?
Like, you think I'll get fat?
So you're saying I definitely
won't get fat?
Well, make up your mind, lady.
Wait, is this a science lesson?
Ugh, that's worse.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Really?
Does Herb know?
I'm going to miss you, Charlotte.
Charlotte...
Why did you bring me to Griffith Park?
Are we gonna get in a knife fight
like in Rebel Without a Cause?
He had several causes.
Wow, I didn't realize
there were so many day hookers.
I'm not fully on board with
this new high five thing.
What ever happened to the low five?
Give me some skin.
What? That's amazing.
What's the show?
Well, good luck on your rocket ship
to the top without me.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Seriously?
Of course I do. Of course, Herb.
Jesus Christ, thank you.
I think you got the wrong idea here.
Herb, I'm not...
Yeah, no, I gotcha.
Yeah.

Why would I say, "You'll never get me
in that sweater" in this scene
and then, in the very next scene,
I'm wearing the sweater?
Did my character suddenly forget
that he didn't want to wear the sweater?
Don't explain the joke to me.
I just don't understand how it's a joke.
I want you to add a scene showing
how I changed my mind about the sweater
so the goddamn episode makes sense.
Look at me, doing your job for you.
Way to go, Shakespeare.
What happened to the stories I requested?
Where's my rap? You said
you'd write me a rap.
We just need a rhyme for
"and I'm here to say."
Well, what about giving me Rollerblades?
How are people gonna know
that my character is hip
if he doesn't roll the blade?
That was one pitch,
and I didn't say they're all thieves.
But if you're too scared to start
a national dialogue, maybe
I'll take my ideas home.
Good luck making Horsin'
Around without the horse.
Okay, Sharona.
I'll go out and jerk this limp script
until it gets hard,
but I'm not doing it for Herb.
I'm doing it for the fans.
And there better be some Zimas
in my dressing room after the show.
Wait a minute. This isn't the bar.
I got to fire my assistant.
You guys sound like
you're ready for a show.
Oh, gross. Why do I
keep trying to like Zima?
Talk to me, world.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, it's Princess Carolyn.
How are you doing today?

BOJACK: Well, I'll tell you my problem.
I just keep getting handsomer.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Good problems to have.
Hold for a sec.
I've got your agent on the line.

BOJACK: Ha-ha. She is attractive.
Uh, Marv? Marv?
What's the big news?
That's amazing.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, God. What did I do this time?
Wha...
Sheeeiiiiit.
No doy.
Okay, I'm gonna hold back my "No doys"
because there might be a lot.
Herb, you picked the
worst possible time to...
You know what? You can count on me, Herb.
I mean, I wouldn't even be
here if it weren't for you.
And when this is all over, we're going
to drive back up to Griffith Park.
I still owe you that high five, right?
Hey, this is a dumb question,
but do you guys ever,
like, all link up together
and do, like, a party
train or a fun circle?
'Cause I feel like I'd
be doing that all the...
Never mind. Stupid question.
Feel stupid for asking that.
See, that's what I'm talking about.
That's great.
We just gotta make sure
that we work in the phrase
"toothbrush rap" early,
so they know I'm rapping.
You can't do that.
Well, if he goes, I go.
Angela...
Wait a minute.
This isn't the bar.
I gotta fire my assistant.

DIANE: So what ended up
happening with Secretariat?

BOJACK: Went into turnaround.
I don't totally know
what "turnaround" means,
but they never made the movie.

TODD: Whoa.
This house is way bigger than yours.
Herb's done really well
for a guy you dicked over.
Oh, no. Ah.

BOJACK: That's enough out of you.
Stay out here and turn this car around
in case we need to leave in a hurry.

TODD: Hooray. A task.

BOJACK: Yeah, you don't look so hot yourself, Herb.

DIANE: Uh...

BOJACK: This is Diane.
She's writing a book about me.

DIANE: Pleasure to meet you.

TODD: Almost. Ah...
Almost there.
Come on... ah.

BOJACK: Uh, they're fine.
Could have seen that coming.
Who asks about utensils?

DIANE: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

BOJACK: Nope. No, you are not.

TODD: Uh. Oh. Ow. Almost.
Oh. Oh, no.
I can't turn the car around.
I've been trying to do this
three-point turn forever.
I mean, it's more like a 300-point turn.
Am I right, huh?

DIANE: Hey, Herb,
is that your Vitamix?
BoJack has one, too.
I wonder if you guys have
strong opinions about
it one way or the other.

BOJACK: I have used mine a grand
total of zero times.
I don't even have cancer,
and I don't use it.
Exactly.
What is so great about liquids?
Every article I read now is
"juice this" and "juice that."
Hey-ooh.

TODD: Uh, I'm going as fast as I can.
No, I think I'm almost there.
Whoa. Whoa, guys.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.
Maybe we should take our
masks off and actually talk.
Did you?
Because I think you're
still wearing a mask.

DIANE: Oh, my God, Herb, you
met President Clinton?
Oh, wow.

BOJACK: I presented at the Teen Choice Awards.
Wait, is that Charlotte?
She looks good for someone so old.
Exactly!

TODD: Truth. Truth.
Kenzie, do you have anything to share?
Word.
You know, I act all cool
and sophisticated on the outside,
but on the inside, I'm just Todd, you know?
But thanks to you guys, I think I'm finally
ready to let my guard down.
Oh!

BOJACK: This... This just doesn't feel right.
I should have brought a bottle of wine.
That's what adults do. BoJack, damn it.

DIANE: Is that what's bothering you,
that you didn't bring wine?

BOJACK: You're right.
I just would have drunk it on the way here.

DIANE: This isn't about wine, BoJack.
If you have something you
need to say to someone,
you should do it while you have the chance
because before you know
it, it'll be too late.

BOJACK: Is this one of those
things where we're talking
about Herb but we're actually
talking about something else?

DIANE: No, I was talking about Herb.

BOJACK: Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.
Hey, buddy!
Ooh, you should get that looked at.
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you about... you know.
I feel bad about what happened.
Yes. I'm sorry.
Herb, I said I'm sorry.
Uh... not sure you get
what's happening here.
This could be the last time that you...
I really think that we'd both
feel better if we just...
You have to believe me.
I did everything I could.
Look, I... I wanted to,
but I didn't think...
It's not my fault you got fired.
I...
Hey, this is a dumb
question, but the gay thing
and the rectal cancer thing
aren't related, are they?
Never mind.
Stupid question. Forget I brought it up.
Huh.
No, you gave this to me.

DIANE: BoJack?
What are you doing? Get off him.

BOJACK: Some people prefer the later years.

DIANE: BoJack. Come on.
Thank you for inviting us.
You have a lovely home.

BOJACK: I don't know why I came here.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You said you wanted a job.

BOJACK: It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wow. What happened in Malibu?

BOJACK: I gotta go.

DIANE: Hey, bright side.
At least now you have a good story to tell
at his funeral.

BOJACK: Ugh, God.

DIANE: I'm not trying to kill the vibe here,
but I've had to pee for, like, three hours.
Look, I won't put what happened today
in the book if you don't want me to.

BOJACK: No, it's okay.
Full truth like we agreed.
Warts and all.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I don't even care what
anybody thinks anymore.

DIANE: Well, for what it's worth,
I think it took a lot of guts
to do what you did back there.
