MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And the Golden Globe for
Best Comedy or Musical
goes to BoJack Horseman, my friend,
for his book One Trick Pony.

BOJACK: Wow, what an honor.
I have to thank the Hollywoo Foreign Press.
I feel like I should mention
that my book was not a comedy or a musical.
Do you guys actually watch
the movies you give awards to?
'Cause I kind of get the sense that...
Also, my book was not a
movie. You do know that, right?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We're friends.

BOJACK: Anyway, the response to this
book has been incredible.
These last three months
have been really amazing.
You know, a lot of people said to me,
"You sure you want to publish this book?
It's pretty personal."
And I said, "If I can make
just one person out there
feel a little less alone,
then it's all worth it."
And they said, "That's really brave."
And I said, "Well, I'm not
one to call myself brave,
but since you said it, yeah, I am."
After-party at my restaurant!
Why did I say after-party
at my restaurant?
I do not want to throw a party.

TODD: It did seem unlike you. I'm
gonna go get some cotton candy.
You want some?

BOJACK: No.
Yes.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: There he is, man of the hour.
Cheer up, dummy. Your
book is a huge success.
Everybody loves you. You
just won a Golden Globe.
If you can't be happy tonight,
maybe you'll never be happy again.

BOJACK: I'm sorry, is that
supposed to be encouraging?
Because it's super-bleak.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER:  Vincent Adultman...
how are things at the old nine to five?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I keep telling him he works too hard.
Come on, Vincent, let's
get away from the rat race.
Take a cruise someplace wet and Latin.
I mean, can you imagine
this body in a swimsuit?

BOJACK: I literally cannot.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Vincent, let's do a lap.
Have you met Brendan Fraser?
I feel like you two would love each other.

BOJACK: I got to hand it to Diane.
This book has been everything
she said it would be.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, she knows what she's doing.

BOJACK: How is Diane? I haven't seen her since...
Well, I haven't seen her in a while.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, the book's
been huge for her, too.
She's practically as famous as I am now.
We're like the Brangelinas.

BOJACK: Well, I'm happy she's happy.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And how are you?

BOJACK: Well, it's been really hard...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Erica, is that you? Who let
you out of the burn ward?
Get over here, you.

BOJACK: It is?
Yeah, definitely. So profound.
Do you want to get out of here?
Come back to my place, maybe
get a little more naked,
honest and revealing?
What about you?
Whoa.

BOJACK: Hello.
Okay.
Okay.
Wow, that sounds amazing.
But that's not usually the
kind of thing I write about.
Well, I am a morning person.
Oh yes, of course.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You want to spend three months in Sudan?

DIANE: Not just there. We're also
going to Haiti and Thailand
and Uganda and Chechnya.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Can't you do all that in L.A.?

DIANE: I want to do something important.
I want to help people and do good work
and sleep on the ground
and poop in a bucket.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Honey, nobody wants to poop in a bucket.

DIANE: Maybe I do. Maybe I
want to poop in a bucket.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: If you want to poop in a
bucket, we can get you a bucket.
You don't have to go all
the way the Chechnylavakia.
Am I saying that right?

DIANE: It's not just the pooping in a bucket.
I think it might be good
for me to get out of L.A.
for a little bit.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Sweetie, you know I support
you, whatever you want to do,
but you're not gonna find
what you're looking for
in these awful made-up places.
The universe is a cruel, uncaring void.
The key to being happy
isn't a search for meaning.
It's to just keep yourself
busy with unimportant nonsense,
and eventually, you'll be dead.

DIANE: Well, I guess I can keep my options open.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Great.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, can I ask you something?
Did Vincent seem extra
weird to you last night?

BOJACK: Well, he's still three kids
in a trench coat, so, no.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: We're going through a rough
patch. It's hard, you know.
He's works a full time job
at the business factory,
so when he gets home,
he just wants to unwind
by watching R-rated movies.
I thought I was ready
for a real adult relationship,
but...
Enough about me. BoJack, you are on fire.

BOJACK: Are we talking about me again?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: We have an offer on the table
for you to play the bad guy
in the new James Bond.
I agree. Total garbage.
But this, it's a new drama
from the Coen Brothers.
A western about a one-horse
town and you're the horse.
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

BOJACK: I think now's the time to
finally make "Secretariat."

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Really? Now? Aren't you a
little, um, very too old?

BOJACK: You asked me what I wanted
to do. That's what I want.
That's all I've ever wanted,
and if I can't get it now,
then all of this has been for nothing.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Fish. Of course!
Why would you ever make things easy for me
when instead you could make
things incredibly difficult?
Laura, clear out the rest of my day.
I have to push a boulder up a hill,
and then have it roll
over me time and time again
with no regard for my well-being.

BOJACK: Attagirl.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right, Todd. PB
Livin' needs a new project.
Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks
has been an enormous success,
but I got into this game to make movies,
so let's make a movie.

TODD: Well, I got a stack of great scripts here.
Any one of them would
make a wonderful movie.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Fantastic.

TODD: But I also have this other
non-movie-related idea.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ooh, let's hear the other idea.

TODD: Okay. I was heading down Wilshire,
and I saw this empty
store front, and I thought,
"You know what this world needs?"

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Edge of my seat over here.

TODD: A store where people
can buy Halloween stuff.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Halloween store. Feel
like that's been done.

TODD: Yeah, in October,
but how come your never see
a Halloween store in January?
It's an untapped market.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah.
A Halloween store that's open year-round.

TODD: No, no. Just January.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Brilliant.
That's the kind of idea
that wins Golden Globes.

BOJACK: Lenny, look, I know I'm a
little long in the tooth,
but I think that you more than anyone
would know not to count out an old pro.
Just set the project up
and give me an audition.
That's all I ask.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Shh. No, no, no.
Put it here. Put it here.

TODD: Okay, I'll do it.
Ahem.
Has this ever happened to you?

BOJACK: Has what ever happened to me?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd?

TODD: Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

BOJACK: What's going on? Why are
you talking like that?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd, I just got a phenomenal idea
for a Halloween costume.
Why don't you and I dash
over to the store right quick
and spend some hard-earned American money?

TODD: But, Mr. Peanutbutter, didn't you hear?
It's January, and the
Halloween store won't open
for another nine months.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: But I want satisfaction now.

TODD: Has this ever happened to you?

BOJACK: Not to anyone ever at any time.

TODD: Ahem. We give you Halloween in January,
a truly immersive Halloween experience
for the rest of us.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Halloween in January? Please elaborate.

TODD: Okay, but before I do, tell the audience.
Have we ever met before?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Never.

TODD: Well, according to facts,
there's more suicides in January
than any other month.

BOJACK: I'm getting pretty close over here.

TODD: Also, there's less Halloween
stores. Coincidence?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow, I'm convinced. This
store could save lives.

BOJACK: Unbelievable. When your powers combine...
you are somehow even more stupid
than the sum of your stupids.

TODD: Thank you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Go on.

BOJACK: You stop encouraging him
and you stop encouraging him.
The two of you are playing with fire.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: A fire called Having a Good Idea.

TODD: Or maybe a fire called Friendship.

BOJACK: Fires aren't called things.

TODD: What about the Chicago fire?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Or Fire Island.

TODD: Or Gabe.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Who's Gabe?

TODD: Just a fire I met once. Named him Gabe.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: He sounds delightful.

TODD: He was. Good guy.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Business, business, business.
Is that all you ever think about?
What's under that coat, Vincent?
You need to let me in.
It's always guys in places with you.
You know, I thought I
wanted to date a real adult,
but I'm actually young at heart.
I need to feel the grass between my toes.
I want to wear jeans. I want to dance.
That's baby stuff.
There's more to being an adult
than just work and business
and the tall-person rides at
Disneyland. I want to have fun.
There has to be a difference
between monogamy and monotony.
Well, clearly we had a
different understanding
of what this was.
I'd like to be an adult about
this, but frankly, I'm hurt.
I think you should just go,
just git. Get out of my life.
Okay.

BOJACK: I really appreciate you
giving me this opportunity.
Secretariat was kind of my hero as a kid.
Well, you know, here was
a guy who had everything...
Great. Let's get to it.
Not today, ma'am.
Today I'm just a customer
who wants a warm slice of pie.
You want to know the truth?
Nothing.
No, I'm running from nothing.
I'm terrified of nothing.
People come up to me,
they want my autograph,
they want my picture.
They think they recognize something in me,
and I want to be that person
they think I am, but I'm not.
They see a greatness in me, and
they mistake it for goodness,
but I... I know there's nothing there.
As fast as I run, I
can't get way from that.
Andrew...
Garfield!

DIANE: Hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane, it's Princess
Carolyn, BoJack's agent.

DIANE: Yeah, I know who you are.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm the pink cat, the one
who used to date BoJack.

DIANE: We've met a lot of times.
You came to my wedding.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Listen, the Turteltaub Company
is making a movie about Secretariat.
And since you're such an expert,
they want to bring you on
board as a character consultant.

DIANE: What does that mean?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's the cushiest job in the world.
You sit in a fancy chair
and eat pastries all day.
And then once a week, you say,
"Secretariat wouldn't do that."

DIANE: I don't know. I've already
been offered this other thing.
And did you know there
are orphans in Sudan...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You take this job, you can
buy all the orphans you want.

DIANE: No, I don't want to buy them.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Look, if you really want to help people,
it doesn't hurt to have a
little money in your pocket.
Take the job now, help the orphans later.
There's always later.
Okay, talk it over with your husband.
I got to go get my whiskers trimmed.
I run into walls for days, but I look hot.

BOJACK: How's the pie here?
Well, I'll take all you got.
Screw it. Throw it in
a bowl with some bourbon
and bring me a
ladle.

TODD: BoJack, we notice you've been
pretty down in the dumps lately,
but we have something that we
think is going to cheer you up.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's an exciting new business venture
that's equal parts new and exciting.

BOJACK: Another one? What happened
to your Halloween store?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What now?

TODD: Right.
The Halloween store.
We took the floor out
because Mr. Peanutbutter kept
scratching up the hardwood,
and then... Did we ever
get the new floor installed?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Anyway, now we're all about smoodies.

BOJACK: What?

TODD: Smoodies.

BOJACK: You're saying smoothies, right? Smoothies.

TODD: No. Smoodies.
It's a mood that you drink like a smoothie.

BOJACK: I don't understand it.
How do you drink a mood?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Like a smoothie.

BOJACK: So it is a smoothie.

TODD: No, it's a smoodie...
A mood that you drink.

BOJACK: How do you drink a mood?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Like a smoothie.

BOJACK: But do you buy it in a store?
What're the physical attributes?

TODD: We haven't worked out all the kinks yet,
but the important thing
is we've gone public,
and we want you to get
in on the ground floor.

BOJACK: See, that's the problem
with all your ideas...
they don't have ground floors.

TODD: Anyway, our launch party's tonight,
and we'd love it if you came.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We spared no expense...
that's how confident we are in our product.

BOJACK: Your product... Smoodies.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yes.
Wait, did you say smoodies or smoothies?
Because we only make...
Which one do we make?

TODD: I'd like to think the smoodies make us.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I can tell by your tone
that that was something smart.
Todd, it is all happening.

TODD: Hooray. And you know I don't
throw that word around lightly.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right. Now we just
got to make sure we focus
and actually follow through on this.
I'd feel awful if this
great idea fell apart
because we got distracted
by something else,
as we are often wont to do.

TODD: Wait, did you say you
feel awful or falafel?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I said, "Feel awful,"
but tell me more about this falafel idea.

TODD: Falafel or fawaffle?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, isn't this
exciting? Smoodies, right?

BOJACK: Do you even know what a smoodie is?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I think it's some kind of an adult onesie.
Whatever it is, I'm trying new things.
I'm single again, and I'm loving it.
Let me repeat...
Vincent. Well, you've got
some nerve showing your face.
I've got half a mind to...

BOJACK: Okay, here we go.
What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Vincent.
Let's.

BOJACK: Hello?
What's up?
What? Are you serious?
I am. I will. I can. I do.
Yeah?
Hey.

DIANE: Hey.

BOJACK: Not big on parties?

DIANE: Nah. I never know what to do with my hands.

BOJACK: I think I just got cast in Secretariat.

DIANE: That's amazing.

BOJACK: It's everything I ever wanted.

DIANE: Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.

BOJACK: What do I do now?

DIANE: Well, that's the problem with life, right?
Either you know what you want,
and you don't get what you want,
or get what you want, and then
you don't know what you want.

BOJACK: Well, that's stupid.

DIANE: Yeah.
I don't know if this makes
you more or less excited,
but I actually decided to take
a job on the Secretariat movie
as a character consultant.
Wow, so we're gonna be
working together again.

DIANE: Yeah. I hope you don't get sick of me.

BOJACK: I don't think that's gonna happen.

DIANE: Is it weird I took this job?

BOJACK: Why would it be weird?
You literally wrote
the book on Secretariat.

DIANE: Yeah, I know. I just...
When I first moved to L.A...
I thought I was gonna be
doing really important work.
You know, writing stuff
that makes a difference.
But then you kind of fall into
one thing and then another...

BOJACK: Well, you've got time.
There's always later, right?

DIANE: Yeah, I guess there's always later.
Do you remember the last time I saw you?
You asked me if I thought you
were a good person deep down?

BOJACK: Do I remember that? Yeah, vaguely.

DIANE: You caught me off guard.
I didn't know what to say.

BOJACK: Well, do you think I'm a
good person... deep down?

DIANE: That's the thing. I don't
think I believe in deep down.
I kind of think all you are
is just the things that you do.

BOJACK: Well, that's depressing.
For what it's worth,
I think your writing
does make a difference.

DIANE: Thanks.

BOJACK: I really wanted you to like me, Diane.

DIANE: I know.

BOJACK: Kids, kids, I don't need a present.
I got everything I need right here.
Come here, you goofball.
Really?
Huh.
