PRINCESS CAROLYN: You got to get your shit together.
So you took some licks, but
you're gonna bounce back,
because you're talented, you're smart,
and damn it, you're good.
You are a goddamn American
treasure, you know that?
You are BoJack goddamn Horseman.
So get the hell off my lawn.

BOJACK: Oh.
Here I thought I was at the
drive-through at Carl's Jr.
How much did I have to drink last night?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Last night? Oh, you've been on a bender
for the last two weeks, ever
since you found out Diane
got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter.

BOJACK: Diane got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter?
I need a drink.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No. No more drinking.
You've been out of control.

BOJACK: Princess Carolyn, look. I met John Stamos.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That is not John Stamos.

BOJACK: Hey, Princess Carolyn,
John Stamos and I got our ears pierced.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That is not your ear.

BOJACK: Princess Carolyn, John Stamos died.
Why? Why, God?
Why did you take John Stamos?
That doesn't sound so bad.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, I forgot to mention you
were naked for a lot of that.

BOJACK: Stamos!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Also, it wasn't here. It was at my office.

BOJACK: We thought night swimming would be fun,
but the current was too strong.
Oh, God, I wasn't driving around, was I?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No. You made Todd your designated driver,
but then you also made him drink with you.

TODD: Yeah, I'll have a western
bacon cheeseburger.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, we are going to
get you back on your feet.
All you need to do is get off Diane
and get on to something else.
Hello?
Tony, hi. I'm calling in that favor.
Get your crew to BoJack Horseman's house.
Can you be there in an hour?
Great.

BOJACK: What just happened?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're the new face of Guten Bourbon.

BOJACK: What is Guten Bourbon?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's an urban German bourbon.

BOJACK: Am I just hungover, or are
you talking like a Muppet?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: They're looking for American celebrities
to talk about how much they like to drink.
It's the part you were born to play.
All you have to do is
smile and stay upright.

BOJACK: I don't know. It sounds like a lot of work.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You take up 80% of my time with your drama
and make me 0% of my money.
Do the damn commercial.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, I got to go. You're in charge, Todd.
Keep this dummy out of trouble.

TODD: Hooray, responsibility.

BOJACK: Hey.
Do you really believe all that
stuff you said to me earlier
about me being smart and talented and good?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, I'm an agent. I
believe everything I say.

BOJACK: Ah.

TODD: Hey, where the hell is that cheeseburger?
I ordered it, like, an hour ago.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Lenny Turteltaub, you skinny bitch.
How the hell are you?
Sorry. Hello?

BOJACK: Hey, I just wanted to thank
you for getting me this job
and pulling me out of that
oh-so-predictably BoJack
spiral of self-loathing
and substance abuse.
You really are the best.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I know. Talk to you later.

BOJACK: I feel like you see things
in me that nobody else sees.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yep, I'm pretty great. Got to go.

BOJACK: All this time, I never even...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, I'm in a very
important breakfast right now.

BOJACK: Okay. I got to go, too.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Sorry. What's the great news?
You beautiful dickhead.
You finally got Zach Braff?
Ah, no other director has enough weight
to handle a movie about
the last days of Eva Braun.
Everything's coming together.
With Braff directing,
my client Cate Blanchett starring,
and the great Lenny Turteltaub producing,
this movie is a done deal.
I'm the best agent in the biz.
I can seal these deals
with my paws in my pants.
Laura! What's happening?
No shit. With what?
Oh, shit. Don't tell me
one of the new agents is...
Vanessa Gekko.
That slippery, slimy,
cold-blooded, bug-eyed...
Gekko.
Ha ha. How are you?
No.
I don't have any children.
I'm pumped.
Oh.
Ugh. What do you want, Todd?

TODD: Well, good news, bad news.
The bad news is that there
actually is no good news,
and the other bad news is BoJack's gone.
What? Where did he go?
The shoot is at his house.
He just disappeared. I don't
even know why he'd leave.
This charcoal mellowed
bourbon is so smooth,
every time I take a sip, pure happiness.
Really?
Hey, I got to go. I think
this is my big break.
Don't worry. I won't let it
get to my head or anything.

BOJACK: Hey, who told that asshole
he could sit in my chair?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Don't forget I'm your
agent, too! I want 10%.

BOJACK: Hello, beautiful.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What the hell are you doing here?
You're supposed to be
shooting a commercial.

BOJACK: I know, but I was sitting
there drinking bourbon and...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: They didn't give you fake bourbon on set?

BOJACK: Oh, they did, and then I
just mixed it with bourbon.
And it hit me.
Why was I so upset about
Diane getting engaged?
You're the one who's
always been there for me,
so I drank a lot more bourbon
and drove over to tell you how I feel.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, I see what this is.

BOJACK: Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?
Clearly we're in love with each other.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're not in love with me.
You're in love with Diane.
And you're not even
really in love with her.
You just think you are because you pay her
to listen to you talk about yourself.

BOJACK: Diane getting engaged was the best thing
that ever happened to me.
It made me realize you're
the one I need to be with.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ha! You say that every
time something bad happens.

BOJACK: Not getting nominated for
a People's Choice Award
is the best thing that ever happened to me.
It made me realize...
Getting caught with that pound of cocaine
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.
That hooker getting pregnant
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei was the best...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Every time something bad happens,
you come running to me for comfort.
Well, it's not gonna happen this time.
I can't be your agent and your girlfriend.
It just doesn't work.
I have to take this.

BOJACK: Okay.
But remember, I'm coming for you,
and I'm gonna make you love me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Please don't. Hey.
Aw, fish. Without a director, Eva
Braun is as dead as Eva Braun.
Hello? Hello?

BOJACK: Lady, you work too hard.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That was an important phone call.
Important phone call beep boop blorp.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Don't you robot-voice me.

BOJACK: Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, I'm working, and you are leaving.

BOJACK: Before I go, I got you
a little sexy something
to remember me by.
Since we can't be together every second,
which would be my preference,
I give you cardboard BoJack.
It's got a light-sensitive sound chip,
so every time you walk by it,
it quotes a line from Jerry Maguire,
your favorite movie.
What do you think? Pretty sweet, huh?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't have time for you or cardboard you.
I need to find a new director.

BOJACK: Or you could find my nude erector...
She's gone.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Blech. Word to the wise, Laura...
Do not pitch a Nazi
romance to Steven Spielberg.
What are you saying?
The hell we are.

BOJACK: Good news, Princess Carolyn.
Vanessa's my agent now.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

BOJACK: You said you couldn't be
my girlfriend and my agent,
so I'm firing you.
Now we can be in love.
This is so great.
Now I can date you and have a better agent.
Everybody wins.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh.

TODD: Are you still searching for happiness?
Make your own happiness.
Mmm, that's some Guten Bourbon.
Was it? You know, I'm
trying to do good work here,
really find the character,
but it's pretty distracting
to have all these robots
staring at me with their blinking red eyes.
Oh, well, you want to make a good one?
Then get them the hell out of here!
I'm the face of this brand,
I'm the man behind the thing,
and I'm determined to get the jargon
of this German bourbon blurbin'.
Is it just me, or does this fake booze
taste a lot like real booze?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You want BoJack, you can have him.
Here's a list of directors
who won't work with him,
studios that won't hire him,
former assistants with restraining orders.
Well, then BoJack should
be a lot of fun for you.
No one wants to hire him.
You gotta be kidding me.
Ha. All yours.
Who said you could use my assistant?
Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.
Ugh.
I'll take it in here, Charlie. Hello.
BoJack is not my client anymore.

TODD: Oh, you pretenders.
Bourbon is the name of a county.
You can't just make bourbon in Germany.
That would be like
making Rice-A-Roni
anywhere but San Francisco.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ugh. I'll be right there.
You got to get your shit together.
You are a winner, okay?
You are Todd... Hold on.
Fish. Okay, you are Todd goddamn...
What's your last name?

TODD: Chavez.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Your last name is Chavez?

TODD: Yeah. Why?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't know, I just never thought of you
as a Chavez. Look, I got to go.

TODD: I feel like you didn't
really finish the pep talk.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I know, but I got a movie to put together.
Best of luck. You got to be kidding me.
You're having the Eva
Braun meeting without me?
But Cate is my client.
Is that Quentin Tarantulino?
Eva Braun is not a romantic comedy.

BOJACK: He's right, you know.
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate. Hey.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I just missed an important meeting
because I was babysitting
Todd, who's too drunk to work,
because you switched out the prop bourbon
with the real bourbon.
You are ruining my life.

BOJACK: Have dinner with me tonight.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No way.

BOJACK: Come on, just me, you,
and a bottle of Pinot.
Probably more than one
bottle and some entrees.
And I'll probably get an appetizer.
I own the restaurant, so we can go crazy.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I have to work.

BOJACK: You don't have to work.
You choose to work.

PRINCESS CAROLYN:  Hmm.

BOJACK: Why not choose to be happy for once?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mm.

BOJACK: When you're writing a memoir,
you spend a lot of time
reflecting on the past.
I regret not being a better friend to you
and lover.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Thank you.
Lover's kind of a weird word,
but thanks.

BOJACK: You want to get out of
this stuffy old restaurant,
get some gelato, and maybe
drive out to the ocean
and put our feet in the water?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That sounds great.
Let me just freshen up my whiskers.

BOJACK: Great. I'll get the car
and meet you outside.
You scamper right back, pussycat.
You look at your reflection too long,
you might fall in love. She's gone.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What do you want, Gekko?
I left at 8:30. What is it?
No. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.
This isn't fair. I know
everything about Cate.
Her favorite color is red.
Her favorite book is Suffragette City.
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.
She's Australian, you moron.
Bye.
Ugh.
Charlie, get me Cate Blanchett.
You know what? Never mind.
If Vanessa Gekko wants Cate
that bad, she can have her.
I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be happy.
Tonight, I choose to be happy.
Good night, Charlie.

BOJACK: Holy shit.
Herb! How the hell are you, buddy?
Excuse me?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Sorry that took me so long.
Just wanted to look my best for you, lover.

BOJACK: Hey, um, I just got kind
of a weird phone call.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You and me both. Hey, screw 'em all, right?

BOJACK: Yeah.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Are we going to gelato?

BOJACK: Princess Carolyn, what are we doing?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Getting gelato?

BOJACK: This was a mistake. I've been acting crazy.
That phone call just
pulled me back to reality.
You were right. I don't love you.
You don't love me. We're
just two lonely people
trying to hate ourselves a little less.
Maybe that's all we're ever gonna be.
Maybe that's all we ever were.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, this night took a turn.
You know the worst part? I
knew this was gonna happen
and I let myself get excited anyway.

BOJACK: So we agree that this is on you, then?
I guess I'll see you around.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're not even gonna give me a ride home?

BOJACK: Sorry, I think I just
need to be alone right now.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Of course, of course.
That's what you get when
you fall for a horse.
Taxi.
You got to get your shit together.
So yesterday, you let yourself
fall in love a little bit,
and you got your heart broken.
Serves you right for having feelings.
Starting now, you are a
hard, heartless career gal.
Go to work, be awesome at it,
and don't waste time on
foolish flights of fancy.
From now on, you are a robot.
Beep bop boop blurp bleep.
Hello.
I just want you to know I'm fine.

BOJACK: Uh-oh. People only say they're
fine when they're not fine.
Did I hurt your feelings last night?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm an agent. I don't have feelings.

BOJACK: Well, I'm glad you called.
I think that you had
the right idea yesterday.
I should be getting back to work.
Can you get me another job?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, well, I'm not your
agent anymore, so, no.

BOJACK: Oh, right. Well, just tell whoever, then.
Anyway, I'm off to
Malibu to see Herb Kazzaz.
He has cancer, which, as
you know, is a whole thing.
Plus, he hates me, so I could
really use some good news
at the end of the day.
PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, my God, you're going to see Herb?
You must be really...
Nope, don't care. Not interested.
Hope you like kicking ass, Charlie,
because that's all we're gonna do today.
That's great, Charlie.
Hey, Vanessa, your client,
BoJack Horseman, wants a job.
Good luck.
What? You just signed BoJack yesterday.

BOJACK: Todd, how do I turn this thing off?
Todd.

TODD: What? I'm busy.

BOJACK: Never mind. Think I've figured it out.
Now that I've got the room to myself,
time to practice the trombone.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: He's kind of in a bad place right now.
You can't just drop him.
The best agent in this building
got him a job yesterday,
and I could get him a
feature by the end of today.
Hey, Marty, Princess Carolyn here.
How'd you like to work
with the BoJack Horseman?
What's that? You hate his guts?
What's that? He's a talentless boob?
What's that? You'll never
work with BoJack again?
What's that?
You want him to die in an
ass factory warehouse fire,
smothering to death under
a pile of burning asses?
Well, if you change your
mind, give me a call.
Oh, BoJack, what am I gonna do with you?
That's it. Of course.
Cameron Crow, you skinny bitch.
You know Jerry Maguire's my
favorite movie of all time?
All your films are so human,
which is super impressive
since you're a crow.
Well, whatever you are...
I brought you this
You'd be the perfect director
to make a movie out of it,
and I happen to know this is
Cate Blanchett's favorite book.
I'll bet she'll drop
everything to play the part.
You should give her a caw.
Oh, no. What happened?
Did Cate drop out of your
little Holocaust movie
so she could make my
little Cameron Crow movie?
Why don't you go home and cry about it
to your loving husband and children?
Thanks, Laura.
I don't know, Lenny.
Eva Braun was Vanessa's project.
You know what would be
a great romantic comedy?
Remember when that guy stole
the D from the Hollywood sign
so he could propose to his girlfriend?
Well, in that case,
you know who'd be great?

BOJACK: Yeah.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Good news.
You're back in my stable,
and I got you the lead
in a romantic comedy.
Who's the best agent in the world?

BOJACK: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I went through hell and back
today, but it was worth it
because I got you a
job. Aren't you excited?

BOJACK: No. I don't know.
I don't care about that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You... You said you wanted a job.

BOJACK: It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wow. What happened in Malibu?

BOJACK: I got to go.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, thanks, Laura. Go
home. I'll see you tomorrow.
Where else would I go?
Thanks, phone.
