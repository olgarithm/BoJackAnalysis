MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Us, too. Because we're
really accounting on you...
to get in on the ground floor of this...
PB Livin' product.

TODD: Has this ever happened to you?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You say you love a toasted bagel.

TODD: Ding. Bagel's ready.
But wait.
Hey. That bagel was too fast.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's why PB Livin'
presents, the Bagel Catcher.
For all those hard-to-catch bagels.

TODD: I thought you were a customer.
I don't get what's happening.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Our business manager was
over the moon for that.
So, what you're saying is, we're just
one great idea away from breaking even?
Are you hiring at your accounting firm?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm waiting for my agent.
He'll be with me any moment.
Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.
Yeah. He's probably just organizing
all the amazing opportunities.
I haven't heard from him in years,
so they've probably been piling up.
Maybe I should just go check on him.
Hello, Ronnie? It's your
favorite client, Mr. Peanutbutter.
Well, I'm coming in. I hope
you're... Oh! Oh, my God.
Ronnie, how'd you get
that belt around your neck,
then caught on the filing cabinet,
which made your pants fall down
while you were researching pornograph...
Oh, I see what happened here.

BOJACK: Did you hear that? New food truck.
We should go.

TODD: Hey, can I get some lunch
money? It's pizza day today.

BOJACK: Sure thing, sport. Wait,
where is it pizza day?

TODD: In my tummy.

BOJACK: Oh...
I propped it up with a Golden Globe.
Yeah. Anyway, I got you something.
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.
Now, you can page me whenever you want.
What? Boobs? Oh, my God.
What scamp came up with that one?
Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?
Okay, love you.
Uh...
No, I don't.
Aw... "I love you. No, I don't"?
Uh... Keys.
Uh-oh.
Get out.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hold it. Hold the elevator.
Ooh. Ah. Ee. Ow.
Goddam it. No. No. Ow.
Oh. Ow. Oh...
Rutabaga, this day already sucks.
My heel broke while I was
at this new food truck,
and I spilled a handful
of gravy all over myself
because they don't
sell bowls, just gravy.
Well, I guess the upside to
being invisible around here
is that none of these assholes
will ever notice what a mess I am.
Aw...
No, no, I'll be okay. And how are you?

DIANE: So, what's the plan for today?
Find a new agent, go on auditions?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me
Mr. Peanutbutter's House, oh, so long ago.
Wander around L.A. with an open mind
and an empty stomach
until I get discovered.

DIANE: But also, like, find a new
agent and go on auditions, right?
Or should I start
stealing food from work?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm just gonna go with the flow
and leave everything up to destiny.
Que sera quesadilla.

DIANE: You know we could lose the house, right?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER:  Diane.

DIANE: Right?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, Diane, Diane.

BOJACK: Diane.

DIANE: Aah!
I wasn't stealing paper towels
to use as dinner napkins. Why?

BOJACK: Here's a funny question for you:
If Mr. Peanutbutter said,
"I love you. No, I don't,"
would you need to talk about that
later and figure out what he meant?
Probably not, right? Because
they're meaningless words?
I mean, language evolves, right?
How can anyone know what anything means?
The answer is nobody can.
Nothing means anything.
So why bother talking about anything?

DIANE: In this scenario, are Mr.
Peanutbutter and I living in our house?
Or are we squatting in an abandoned
Barnes & Noble burning books to keep warm
as we struggle through our
Dickensian-style poverty?

BOJACK: Uh...
"Zero, zero, zero." No
idea what that means.

DIANE: I think it means "call me."

BOJACK: Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?
How do I ignore?

DIANE: I think with a beeper,
you just ignore it.

BOJACK: With what, my mind?

DIANE: You seem a little stressed out.

BOJACK: That's because as soon
as I'm done with work,
I have to have a long,
awkward conversation
with Wanda about our relationship,
unless... I'm never done with work.
Diane, you magnificent
bastard. That's it.

BOJACK: Mm. Yeah.
Your line is, "And I'll
see you at the finish line."
Yeah, I know. I'm acting. Great.
Now I gotta start all over.
Settle in, folks. We
could be here a while.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ow! Ooh.
So good of you to join us eventually.
Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.
He is?
Of silence?
To offer their condolences?
Who do you want me to call?
I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's
clients including all the major J's:
Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams.
"Mr. Peanutbutter"?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Here I go. Destiny, don't
fail me now. [grunts]
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.
This is how it happens
for a guy like me.
Ew...
Out of my way, flyer.
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be
on my shoe in front of this store?
Wait, a second. Shoe.
Store.
Shoe store? Shoe store.
"Team players wanted"?
Oh, I'm such a good team player,
I make all the other team
players look like garbage.
Lady Footlocker, meet your lord.

BOJACK: Finish... 
line.
What? No. Why stop now?
I'm just getting warmed up.
Go home?
Why go home when we could extend
this long day's journey into night?
Drinks on me, folks.
Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.
Me, too.
Blue-face blastoff?
What?
Oh, right. Right.
Yeah. The auto-erotic...
Can't believe you have
so many names for it.
Don't need to talk
about how you masturbate.
Okay, I guess we do.
So, like a normal rainbow?
Okay, this is getting really graphic.
Can we maybe talk about anything else?
Thank God.
Uh...
So, noose-wise, what are we talking?
You use a standard sailor's knot
or more like your average
birthday-present bow?
Oh, hey. About this morning...
Because when I said that...
What?
So, last night when...
Can't just say, "I don't
love you" to someone.
Yeah, but that was different.
Because you do love me. Right?
Like a little bit?

TODD: Uh, for what it's worth,
I love both you guys.

BOJACK: Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Jessica Atkinson, come on down.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mr. Peanutbutter?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Would you like to see what's in
box number one or box number two?
Either way, it's a
brand-new pair of shoes!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh.
Rutabaga...
What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!
The author of Catcher in the Rye?
And... others?
Isn't he dead?
Oh, my God.
Why are you giving this lead to me?
Huh.

BOJACK: Corduroy, what are you doing here?
No, no, no.
Your kit?
Yeah I don't know if I want your
jack-off kit at my house.
Wait. So, you're saying
if someone loves you,
they don't want you to choke
yourself while masturbating?
All right. I'll take it.
I still don't understand
why you need a kit.
Can't you just use,
like, a belt or a rope?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hm...
Oh. Ooh.
Oh, hello. I'm looking for some...
Okay, then, I would like to buy a
bicycle. What would you recommend?
One with a bell, or...?
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.
Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye?
And others.
I wanna say The Hobbi...
Look. I'm an agent.
It doesn't matter whether
I've read your work.
What matters is I can look you in
the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.
The world is ready for your
comeback, and I wanna help.
But, J.D. Salinger,
you are J.D. Salinger.
You are a goddamn American treasure.
What if I told you there was a
place where no one reads books?
A place where people only read
headlines, lists and pictures.
A place where people
hate reading so much,
they hire others to do it for them
and don't even pay a living wage.
Exactly.
And all those modern reading
slaves really wanna be doing
is writing things that, one day,
other people will also avoid reading.
Come with me, J.D. Salinger.
Let's go to Hollywoo.

BOJACK: Hup!
Oh... Hey.
We need to talk.
You're probably wondering what
this beautiful mahogany box is.
It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.
I've decided to do
the funky Spider-Man.
I came up with that one myself.
Because he hangs,
then he shoots webbing.
Yes. I do.
Even though it's very dangerous
and I could die.
Now, if you love me, you probably
wouldn't want me to do it.
Since you don't, I should do it, right?
I mean, there's no reason
not to... unless you love me.
Wait. Seriously?
Only if I do it wrong.
Because as I mentioned
before, it's very dangerous.
I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.
If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all out.
A big job like that needs lumber,
and pulleys, lemons, so forth.
I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.
Not too late to stop me.
Good 'cause don't.

TODD: Stop fighting!
Can't you two see what
this is doing to me?
I've been acting out. 

BOJACK: Todd? Get in the car.
It's time to get serious
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

TODD: Hooray! Question mark?

BOJACK: Just play it cool, Todd. No one
needs to know why we're here.
Excuse me, I'm looking for something
that will hold up a lot of weight.
Let's say something that could hoist
up a horse comfortably by the neck.
Not for suicide purposes.
I'm trying to have a
more fulfilling orgasm.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: The world wept when news
broke that J.D. Salinger died.
But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.
As one of the 20th century's
most celebrated authors,
J.D. Salinger has inspired
countless dreamers,
eighth graders and
occasionally, assassins.
His spare lyricism and
devotion to character
will undoubtedly translate into a
penetrating dramatic work for this,
the golden age of television writing.
J.D. Take it away.
What?
It's maybe more of a working title.
Boy that must be a long marquee.
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Who wants to be in Nike Airs?
Claire, you are looking off the
charts "gorge" in those tennis shoes.
But let me ask you this:
Would you like to buy a towel?
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mr. Peanutbutter?
How would you like to be the host of
J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.
You know, it just goes to show,
with the right attitude,
every single one of your dreams
will always come true.
And if your dreams don't come true,
it's probably because you just
didn't have the right attitude.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.
Come again?

BOJACK: Still alive? Because auto-erotic
asphyxiation is so risky?
Well, here I am, for now.
Yeah. I was at the hardware store
picking up supplies for my
auto-erotic asphyxiation machine.
Because, as you are aware,
I'm preparing to auto-erotic
asphyxiate myself.
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you
could at least get a good night's sleep.
He is never gonna forget that.
This isn't about anything but
the pursuit of the kind of orgasm
that feels like a
rainbow with every color.
No.
So, if you don't mind, as
long as you don't love me,
I have a noose to step
into. 
I just need to release this lever,
drop these bags of sand,
which act as counterweights,
and then just pull this nozzle.
Perfect.
Wait, Wanda. 
I... I knew it.
What? That doesn't sound like me.
Okay.
Just for the record, I never really
wanted to do this in the first place,
Me not doing it is not
a sign that I love you.
It's just because I'm a coward.
I don't love you.
I don't. Come back
here. I don't love you.
You don't make me feel less broken.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't get it.
I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker
store employee a primetime show
and resurrected a certified
dead man and nobody cared.
Why do I do anything?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Yes, Rutabaga?

BOJACK: Corduroy? I don't want
this thing anymore.
Corduroy?
Hey, you decent, man?
Oh, sweet Jesus.
