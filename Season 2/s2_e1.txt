BOJACK: I know. I know.
I will.
I can change and I will change.
I can change and I will change.
You're an audiobook.
People all need to see.
Yeah, a little to the right.
No, house right.
That's an acting term.
It means left. I'm an actor.
No.

TODD: BoJack, why did I wake up in an alley?

BOJACK: I had to get rid of the old couch, Todd.

TODD: While I was sleeping on it?

BOJACK: The couch was a metaphor
for my old attitude.
My audiobook told me I had to let go
of the burdens of my life sofa.
Oh, you know what?
Maybe it was "my life so far."

TODD: I still feel like
you could've woken me up first.

BOJACK: Todd, no one can wake anybody else up.
You need to wake yourself up.

TODD: I don't know if I trust this new guy.
I'm just gonna go sleep in your car.

BOJACK: Uh-oh. I think someone needs a FAB.

TODD: A FAB?

BOJACK: FAB, stands for fresh active BNA.

TODD: BNA?

BOJACK: Brand-new attitude. Try to keep up.
ATTITUDE stands for attention to--

TODD: Did you also get rid of my stuff?
Where's my duffel bag?

BOJACK: I value you.
Hashtag "thank you for being a friend."
Hashtag "PANTS."
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this is the worst.
This feels awful.
Why does anybody run?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: And she had no idea
that her boyfriend was the strangler.
I guess some people just see what
they wanna see, right, Vincent?

BOJACK: Hey, Princess Carolyn.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I gotta go.
One of my dumb-ass clients is here.

BOJACK: Just out for a jog, thought I'd say hello.
I jog now.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You jogged here from Laurel Canyon?

BOJACK: I drove, but I moved my arm a bunch,
so the Fitbit counted the miles.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Thank you, Stuart.
I said "latte."

BOJACK: What happened to Laura?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Assistants are like Belushi brothers.
Good ones leave too soon,
bad ones never go away.

BOJACK: It's a beautiful day, though, right?
Every morning is a miracle.
Hashtag "miracle."
Hashtag "every morning."
Hashtag "every morning is a miracle."
Hashtag "BoJack thoughts."

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm glad you found your bliss, but are you
ready for your first day on set tomorrow?

BOJACK: You mean, am I amped?
Because I am so pumped.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: This Secretariat movie is a big deal.
Please do not blow it.

BOJACK: Why would I blow it?
I have a brand-new attitude.
You know, when I won that Golden Globe
last month, I went to a very dark place.
I was in a hole.
And I realized, "I can wallow
in this hole or I can change."
While I was tempted to go with the former,
sometimes the only way out of a hole
is a latter.
No pun intended.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You clearly intended that pun.

BOJACK: Princess Carolyn,
you gotta believe in the AHP of TPE. Huh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Uh-uh. I'm not asking.

BOJACK: The awesome healing power--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I am not asking.

BOJACK: of total positive energy.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You should leave because
I'm about to pretend to get a phone call.
Hello? No, he's still here.
No, he's not taking the hint somehow.

BOJACK: Mm-hm.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Honey, where's my bandana?

DIANE: You chewed it up,
we had to throw it away, remember?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, not that one.
The one with the bones on it.
With the meat juice stains?
The one I wore to the Emmys.

DIANE: I don't know. I gotta go.
BoJack's gonna be here any minute.
Did you check the hall closet?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I can't see anything in this stupid thing.

DIANE: I know, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But you gotta keep it on
for one more week.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I look like an idiot.

DIANE: You look very responsible.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Is the bandana doing anything?

BOJACK: Hey, work buddy,
first day on the job, huh?
Hashtag "great day to start fresh
at a new job, sincerely, BoJack."
@Diane.

DIANE: Can't believe you wanted to carpool.

BOJACK: Gotta save the planet, Diane.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, is that BoJack Horseman?
I don't know because I have no peripheral
vision. Going off of smell here.

BOJACK: Mr. Peanutbutter, how the hell are you?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Loving it, buddy. Loving life.

BOJACK: Brother, I am right there with you.
I got a brand-new attitude
and I am also loving life.

DIANE: Uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, look at us.
A couple life-lovers over here.

DIANE: Uh...

BOJACK: Is that a new cone? Looking sharp, PB.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It is a new cone.
Is it obvious I'm wearing a cone?

BOJACK: Didn't notice.
You've got the smile of a winner.

DIANE: What's going on?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I have to wear the cone
so I don't gnaw on the stitches I had
to get when I punched a mirror last week.
I got drunk and thought my reflection
was another dog.
I was so mad at that other dog.
He was wearing my clothes.

BOJACK: Hey we've all been there brother.

DIANE: I don't understand what's happening.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Did someone say something to the left?
Diane, is that you?

BOJACK: Hey, why don't we just us two schedj
a hang for this 'kend?
"'Kend" is how I say weekend now.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh, I love that. And I got a pair of tix
to the 'Stones show this 'kend.
Wanna go?

BOJACK: The Rolling Stones?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What? Oh, no, no, no.
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

BOJACK: I'm not really familiar with that outfit,
but I do love trying new things.

DIANE: Who are you?

BOJACK: Anyway, we gotta get to work.
It was really great talking to you,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right, break a leg, good buddy.
Diane, BoJack's ready to go.
Where are you, sweetheart?
Are you ready?

BOJACK: Happiness is a metaphor--

TODD: Where are we going?

DIANE: Oh, my God.

BOJACK: Hey, man.
Corduroy Jackson-Jackson.
Oh, right, the underwear guy.
Hey, man, that's
fantastic/great/I-ran-out-of-things.

DIANE: Hi. Kelsey Jannings?
I'm Diane.
I'm here to be a character consultant.
I got a call from the studio.
This cable?
What?
Oh. Sorry.

TODD: I just--
Thank you.
Whoa.

BOJACK: Guys, could I get
everyone's attention, please?

DIANE: Oh, watch out for the cable.
Don't trip over the cable.

BOJACK: I just want everyone to know
what an honor it is to be here.
Secretariat has always been
a personal hero of mine.
A complex role that requires
a precise touch and a deft hand
and I just can't wait to tackle it
head-on.
It's truly an honor.
Namaste.
You got it.
What are you doing here?

DIANE: Hello?
Sebastian,
I know you're doing important work.
I couldn't just drop everything
and fly to the Third World.
I just got married, and
I know, and I'll be there in three months,
as soon as I'm done on the movie.
This is also important.
In a way.
Yep. Lucky me.

BOJACK: Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh.
What are you doing here?
That was bad. I know that was bad.
Let's keep it rolling.
Okay.
What are you doing here? Did we get it?
I can tell by your face that we didn't.
All right, let me try again.
What are you doing--?
I am having trouble with the words.
Is it okay if I play around with it a bit?
When did you get here?
Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.
Man, these lights are bright, huh?
Can we kill these lights at all?
Is that a--?
Okay, I'm sad.
I'm sad. Acting sad.
Secretariat is sad.
Okay, here we go.
I'm sad!
Sorry, what was the line?

DIANE: I don't know if this helps or not,
but when Secretariat was a kid
he actually

BOJACK: So, let me get this straight.
Bad means good?
That's your takeaway?
That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen?
That's Yeah Are you--?
Can you check on our drinks?
I would love some gin. Well that's not--
And you've always been a pillar of support.
Gin, please? Is there gin coming?
Yes, a T-shirt.
That is the worst thing that's happened to anyone
in a theater.
Here we go.
Vodka? Triple sec?
Looking for any alcohol.
As long as one of us dies,
that's good enough.
Can we please get some alcohol
into my mouth?

DIANE: Hey, do you wanna talk?

BOJACK: Talk? Why? Why would we do that?
So you can put everything
in a book and sell a million copies?

DIANE: Wow. Uh...

BOJACK: That's what the old me would have said.
The new me doesn't hold a grudge.
No.

DIANE: I gotta say,
the new you seems a little on edge.

BOJACK: What? Me?
I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker.
That's a metaphor, Diane.

DIANE: Actually it's a simile.

BOJACK: Goddamn it.
Oh, okay. Hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Small talk, small talk, small talk.
Are you blowing it?
I heard you're blowing it.

BOJACK: What? Who told you that? Was it Todd?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ.
If you don't--
Hey, can you hold on a second?
I'm getting another call.
Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga,
the boy prince of the 26th floor.
Okay, you gotta
keep this close to the vest
but I am inches
from getting Emily VanCamp
the lead in Goose Van Sant's
new movie about Jackie O.
You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga,
for a 26er. 

BOJACK: I don't think she's coming back to this call.

TODD: Could we keep it down
in the front, please?
Thank you.

BOJACK: What am I gonna do?

DIANE: Well, you were an actor for nine years
on Horsin' Around. How did you do that?

BOJACK: Uh... Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
Am I-- Am I a clown?
But I am a good actor, right?
Hitting your mark, saying your lines,
loudly with good diction.
Should I be doing more?
To capture the character
and make the audience connect?
Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.
All this time, I assumed there was more
to me than everyone thought
but maybe there isn't.
That's the part where you're supposed
to disagree with me.

DIANE: Oh, right.
Well, you got the part, didn't you?
What did you do in the audition?

BOJACK: Well, how should I know?
That was the old me.
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.
What should I do?
Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?
Start a new life there?
Meet a local girl? Fall in love?
Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?
Work my way up until I own the place?
What am I talking about?
I can't run a textile plant.
Too much responsibility. What am I
gonna do? The walls are closing in!

DIANE: BoJack, breathe. You can do this.
You have two days.
Maybe you could hire an acting coach.

BOJACK: Yeah?

DIANE: Yeah.
Plus, you can watch old
Secretariat videos.
I've got a hard drive full of research.

BOJACK: Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I can do this.
I've got two whole days.
And when the pressure's on,
that's when I shine.
Yeah. Two days.
I can do all those things.
Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
No?
Really?
What?
Wait, which Belushi?
I gotta go on Kimmel now?
What if he makes me read a mean tweet?
I'm not emotionally prepared.
I don't know. I thought I wanted this,
but now I'm feeling all this pressure.
Think you made a mistake, hiring me?
It's Command-Z.
I'm trying to have this new attitude,
be this better, more positive guy.
I keep thinking about how this movie
is my last shot at happiness.

TODD: Aw.

DIANE: Yes.
Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

BOJACK: What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So, I went a little overboard
and I made you two mixes.
The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.
The second CD is all of the Bosstones'
side projects and solo singles.
Listen to it and imagine the band
never took that hiatus
in the mid-aughts
when America briefly lost interest in ska.

BOJACK: I don't have time.
I don't wanna listen to your music.
I don't wanna hang out.
Get out of here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right. You don't wanna listen
to Bosstones together.
That's the impression that I get.
Is it the impression that I get?

BOJACK: Yes. That's the impression that you get.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I see. Way to go, Mr. Peanutbutter.
What a stupid move. Why did you--?

TODD: BoJack, listen, I know you're scared,
but it's gonna be okay.
You gotta be strong.

BOJACK: Yeah, but--

TODD: You gotta rise to the occasion, okay?
So what if the new couch is weird?
Or lumpy?

BOJACK: Uh, what?

TODD: What are you gonna do?
Just sleep in BoJack's car forever?

BOJACK: Are you talking to me, or you--?

TODD: Damn it, time to stop being a coward.
It's time to go home
and sleep on BoJack's couch. Hurray!
Happy ending for Todd!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Charley. Listen, I wanted to touch base
about Emily's start date on Jackie O.
Are you saying the Van Sant camp
wants t  recant on VanCamp?
Because they can't.
Charley, you better get your client
to change his mind
or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and--
What?
I know you're there, Charley.
I'm not gonna leave a message.
Hey, Charley, Princess Carolyn again.
Listen--
What? Mailbox full?
Wait-- No--
Rutabaga, this is not a good time.
How did you like the opera?
I put that movie together for my client.
Carolyn? I only heard one stomp.

BOJACK: What do you want, Mom?
Do you need more blood?
Oh.
That was a diary.
Mom--
What?
Lubitsch?
What are you doing here?
