BOJACK: That's all right. I've learned
that when you're in a loving family
there's nothing wrong
with a little horsin' around.
Thanks for coming out.
Thank you very much.
All right!
I was wondering
where you wandered off to.
Hey.
Yeah, same for me.
Yeah?
Did he tell you anything else?
Well that's probably--
Oh, you did read that part?
I just wish
there was something I could do.
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?
I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.
I mean, a bottle of vodka?
New Mexico?
I thought you lived in Maine.
I always pictured you there.
A little house by a lake?
Oh.
Do you think everyone here read my book?

TODD: Well I didn't.

BOJACK: Of course you didn't.
Here's the CliffsNotes version:
Shut up, Todd!

TODD: Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk
of your car for the next few hours.
Have fun being sad.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Do you know what you're supposed to do
with our date pits?
Why serve dates
and not have a place to put the pits?
You know,
some people just have no class.

BOJACK: What are you doing here?
You didn't know Herb.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, but I do know a hot ticket,
and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.
Henry Winkler,
Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal,
that Pakistani girl
who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

BOJACK: There's so much to hate
about what you just said.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Good news. You know when someone dies,
everyone wants to buy their shit?
You're lucky you have a piece
of Horsin' Around,
because this is where money
starts rolling in.

BOJACK: What I don't want that. That's blood money.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, what do you want me to do with it?
It's coming.

BOJACK: I don't know. Give it to some orphans.
I can't deal with this.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, come on!
You don't think Elton John
was raking it in when Diana died?
More like "Candle in the Windfall."
Cha-ching! Hmm...

BOJACK: Huh.
Hey, Joelle,
I actually came here to be alone.
This might be a stupid question,
but were you always so... British?
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure
you used to be American.

BOJACK: Hey, when was the last time
all four of us were in the same room?
Come on, Sarah Lynn.
Guys, hey, hey, come on.
Guys, can we just be civil for one day?
What's that mean?
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which
one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.
Well, no one knows how to get
under your skin like family.
Why are you all looking at me?
Just take the disk from the guy.
What are we supposed to do
with a floppy disk?
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?
Because it was under tap dancing star
Savion Glover's office. Let's go.
Yeah. Don't you get it?
Herb's giving us a reunion special.
Remember how he always wanted to do
a treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Around
but the network said it was too edgy?
This is that episode.
Wait, so you'd rather just stay
at this funeral and be sad,
instead of going on a crazy adventure
to find our dead friend's secret treasure?
Do you have any idea
how insane you sound?
No, that's not it.
Herb clearly wanted us to do this,
as a family.
Yeah. He was my best friend
and he died hating me
and nothing I do is gonna change that,
but Herb left you that disk
because he wanted us to find his gold.
If we can honor Herb's last wish,
then that's something.
I don't know what, but it's something.
Brad, hang on one second.
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?
Okay.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it?
About our friend Herb?
Yeah. I know.
Those other people are the worst.
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.
We also volunteered at a, um...
soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen!
Whichever one is the good one.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What? I never knew you did that.
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you
talk about how you knew Herb?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, I never met the guy.
I'm just here to schmooze.
Tell us about your thing, though,
it sounds fascinating.
Everyone, gather round and listen
to Princess Carolyn's story.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay.

BOJACK: He sure did.
How could you like Horsin' Around
but not the horse?
That's like watching Castle
but hating castles.
I mean, I've never seen it.
I assume it's about castles.

TODD: Wow!
Look at all these old 20th century relics.

BOJACK: How did you get here?

TODD: I was in your trunk.
Now I'm in outer space.

BOJACK: Todd cut it out with your childish high jinks.

TODD: Whoa, can't I help?

BOJACK: Here's 10 bucks. There's a Squirt machine
by the garage. Get five cans.

TODD: You got it. I won't let you down.
Oh, no!

BOJACK: Your mom, was her name Karen?
Something with a "K"?
Nora? I don't know.
I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

TODD: Okay, Todd, you can do this.
Five Squirts.
You just need to take this money
and put it in that machine.
This-- Wait, what?
What happened to the $10?
No! Wind! Be cool!
Hey! That's mine!
Oh...
Why does this always happen to me?

BOJACK: Oh, this is easy. Try "BoJack."
"BoJack-BFF"?
"BoJack-I-Forgive-You"?
Well, I'm out of ideas.
So in that memory,
were you British or American?
At long last, can you keep down the noise,
keep down the funk?
If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing,
it would have caught on by now!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: And when the mayor gave us the key
to the city,
Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.
It's about people."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Or could it?
Princess Carolyn, sing us another song
in the key of Kazzaz.
You clearly knew the man so well.
Please tell us another story
but with even more details.
Story, story!
Come on, everybody.
What is this, a funeral?

TODD: Well, you blew it again.
You really are a dweeb.
Whoa, who are you?
Some kind of magical trash troll?
Looks like a bunch of old junk.
Oh, yeah.
It was so funny how he never knew
whether or not he did that.
Mr. Janitor, you're standing next
to a machine right now.
So if I go through that magic machine,
I'll become cool and confident?
I feel different.
Todd? Who's Todd?
My name's Toad. Toad Chavay.
And I gotta get my bubble on.
Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah!
That'll do, machine.

BOJACK: Oh, shit.
Herb's nurse is a bear.
You think she knew about this gold?
He must have been waiting for Herb to die
so he could steal the book
and publish it himself.
Oh, my God.
Guys, I don't think
that car crash was an accident.
I think Herb might have been murdered!

TODD: My name's Toad, baby.
Yeah.
Coolsville, daddy-o.
Oh, lookie here.
Yeah.
Oops. Did I do that?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: And when the river finally stopped,
Herb went over
to a poor little Ottawan boy
and he said, "Son, you have water now."
You know, a lot of people go their
whole lives and they never give a damn.
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And make sure you take a video,
and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.
So we can always remember
your great friendship.

BOJACK: Everybody, stop!
Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!
You know that's not what I meant.
You murdered Herb
so you could publish his book.
But we're not gonna let you
steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.
What?
Well, I'll see for myself.
"The air in 1830s California was fragrant
with the flowers of laughter
and the smoke of adventure."

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh.

BOJACK: "The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.
Hungry for crumpets.
But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."
He's right. Herb wanted a legacy,
but he already has one.
People loved Horsin' Around.
This would only ruin that.
I'm sorry I accused you of murder,
American TV legend Henry Winkler.
I guess it was just easier to believe
that you killed him for his book
than believe that he just died
for nothing.
I just wanted to fix things somehow.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow, heady stuff.
But let's not get distracted
from what a true friend
Princess Carolyn is.
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Fantastic.

TODD: Hey. Special delivery.
Courtesy of the Toad-man.

BOJACK: Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up
your sleeves like that? You look weird.

TODD: Oh, I-- 
Well, you know, I was--
I was trying out a new look.
It was-- It was a dumb idea.
Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow... Ow!

BOJACK: Nah.
Hey, we never got a chance
to walk around the lot.
Wanna check out that water tank
where they filmed The Love Boat?
Are you kidding? I've always wanted
to get tanked in a tank.
Oh, okay, okay.
You ready?
What?
Well, that's Hollywood for you.
Hey.
Are you scared at all?
That if the show takes off,
everything's going to change?
