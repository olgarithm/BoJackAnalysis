MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So, did
you have a good birthday?

DIANE: It was an amazing birthday!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I had a great day, too.
I wish every day could be like
this. Just the two of us, together.

DIANE: Yeah? You weren't too bored
by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in
conversation with Helen Molesworth"?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Are you kidding?
I loved "Women on the Wall: An
Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in
conversation with Helen Molesworth."
It combined my two favorite things:
modern art and people
talking about modern art.
I loved everything
about today. Thank you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So, there's nothing else you want?

DIANE: No.
All I want is to get into bed,
listen to Prairie Home Companion
and snuggle up to my wonderful husband.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You don't want anything else?

DIANE: No. Today was perfect.
Any additional thing would be overkill.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay. If you say so.

DIANE: Oh, my God.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Are you surprised? Tell
me you're surprised.

DIANE: Uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: She's speechless. Oh,
we got her good, folks.
Now let's party!

DIANE: He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?
He is dead, goddamn it!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh...

BOJACK: Hey, we should go.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, don't leave.
There's so much party left.
Paul McCartney's gonna
jump out of a cake.

BOJACK: Sorry, Wanda and I have to
get to a prior engagement...
A prior engagement party.
Engagement, so it's a
Prior engagement party.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What?

BOJACK: And we gotta get there early
because of the. Si...
Auction, yeah.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay.

BOJACK: To benefit Berto Eco's fight
against heart disease...
His fight against
heart disease awareness.

TODD: Wait, BoJack!
No! You're my ride.

BOJACK: Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'll take you home.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Come on, stick around a little.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had a
wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Come on, Todd, get in the car.

TODD: Okay.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I give them three months.

TODD: Well, what makes you say that?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Let me think about,
what was my first clue?
Ah! Remember that time
at Diane's birthday party
when they got in that
huge screaming match
over whether or not
Tony Curtis was dead?
That was weird.

TODD: I don't wanna start another fight,
but is he dead?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.
The man's a national treasure.
He's the one speck of romance
in this tainted cynical world.

TODD: I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?
Vincent?
That kid looks just like my boyfriend.

TODD: Does he?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'd know that face anywhere.

TODD: Well, hey, people look
like people all the time.
A lot of folks say that I
look like Octavia Spencer
or the Prince of Cordovia or that
guy from the Guten Bourbon ads.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: How could I have been so stupid?
This is why he never invited me
to his house, why I've
never met any of his friends.

TODD: What are you saying?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Vincent has a secret family.
That kid was his son. The lady
was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

TODD: Uh... where are we going?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I need a drink.

TODD: Are you gonna take me home first?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You better call me back, asshole.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
It's like you're three different people.

TODD: So, you're not gonna take me home first?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Should I call him again?

TODD: I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ugh. No wonder he wears a
trench coat all the time.
It's because he's so sneaky.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, my God, that's him!
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy
down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

TODD: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Vincent has a terrible temper.
He throws tantrums.
If he finds you in my apartment,
who knows what he's capable of?
But, also, stay close,
because if he finds me alone,
who knows what he's capable of?

TODD: Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Looking young.
Huh?
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy?
Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

TODD: Ugh.
Ah. Herb.
Oh, nope.
Phone, I'm bored.
How many ounces are in a barrel?
Well, I'm out of questions.
Do you have any questions for me?
Um...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, well, well, look
what the me dragged in.
Is it dragged or drug?
Either way, drop dead.
Not so fast, cowboy.
Why didn't you tell me any of this?
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know?
Should you check on Kevin? He's
been in the bathroom for a long time.

TODD: And when you don't regret
the tattoo in the morning,
that's how you know it's love.
Yes, Phone?
Oh, um...
Uh, what?
What is happening?
What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?
Okay.
Weird, I still haven't seen
the two of you together.
Okay.
So, Kevin, how do you like school?
Oh, you're back.
Can I get you a drink?
Okay, not talking, huh?
See, this is part of the
problem. We don't communicate.
Do you really think now is the
best time to read the paper?
Vincent?!
Sure, sweetheart.
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?
Now where did he go?
Well, I got this snack for him.
What? Why?
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.
Oh. There you are. Here you go.
Vincent, I'm trying to have
a conversation with you.
Can you take that towel off your head?
And what happened to my bowling ball?
What?!

TODD: Oh, this is too much.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Listen, Vincent, I think we should...
Vincent, why do you have
chocolate on your face?
I gave Kevin the chocolate.
All right, this is
crazy. What are we doing?
You know, when we first met, I was
looking for something in my life.
And I wanted it so badly that I
made myself believe you were it.
But I think that wanting
to believe something
isn't the same as something being real.
And this isn't real.
I think it's time we stop pretending.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, you wanna go home?

TODD: Okay.
Did you guys work it out?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: We broke up.

TODD: Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah.
I guess I was just foolish
enough to believe this dumb world
still had a little
spark of romance in it.

TODD: Well, you can still believe that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, I gotta stop kidding myself.
Tony Curtis is dead.

DIANE: He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?
He is dead, goddamn it!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh...

BOJACK: Hey, we should go.
No, I don't think you bake
Paul McCartney into the cake.
You bake the cake first and
then McCartney gets inside.
Look, what happened back
there is not your fault.
That's just what happens
when two people live together.
Do you think maybe we're going too fast?
I don't want to get in a fight.
We moved in together
without really giving it much thought.
Sure, it's great now.
But it could be not great later and
I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend
if I didn't prematurely freak out
about that. I mean, what is this?
Uh, sure.
Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?
Okay, okay.
Orchid bushes?
I'm sorry you said this
gardener was the best.
And?
That's the punch line?
I'll say.
Makes me think you forgot
the rest of the joke.
I got the narrative. That wasn't
the source of my confusion.
The confusion was about
the joke not being funny.
Everything doesn't always
have to be funny. Just jokes.
Listen, Wanda.
I think maybe there's some
things we kind of glossed over
as we rushed into this relationship.
We don't know each other at all.
Maybe we should take a step back and...
A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?
Yeah, that's the sound a stick
makes when you hit it with your car.
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.
Hey, what are you doing here in the
middle of the road? Are you crazy?
He's fine. He's in the woods.
You know, you hit a deer and
they limp off to the woods to...
continue living their
lives. What are you doing?
If you wanna go for a walk in
the woods at night, go crazy,
but I'm not going anywhere.
Okay, knock yourself out.
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
No, thank you.
What?!
Damn it.
BoJack to the rescue.
We should go back. Nothing
more we can do here.
What is your plan here exactly?
What? What is it?
How can you see that far in the dark?
Oh, right.
Okay, now you're just showing off.
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just...
Just let us get you to a damn hospital.
Not standing in the middle of the
road will also help, in the future.
I am not going to hurt you.
Starting now.
Oh, great. Great.
Well, is it a joke or is it a story?
I'll listen to another story,
if you stop calling them jokes.
Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?
The ex-boyfriend?
What? Oh.
Wow, that is actually
a really good joke.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'll take you home.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, come on, stick around a little.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Nope. I gotta take Todd home.
Had a wonderful time.
Really. It just flew by.
Come on, Todd, get in the car.

TODD: Okay.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Um, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

DIANE: What happened? No, I don't
wanna talk about what happened,
I just wanna clean up.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay.

DIANE: Why? What do you think happened?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I just...

DIANE: Because what I think happened
is that BoJack's girlfriend asked
what Tony Curtis was up to
and I said, "Tony Curtis died."
And you said, "Did he?"

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Right, but...

DIANE: And I said, "Yes, he did."
And you said, "Really?
I'm not sure about that."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah...

DIANE: And I said, "Well, I am." And
you said, "I'm not so sure."
And I said, "I'm telling
you, Tony Curtis is dead."
And you said, "Let's
check the Internet."
And I said, "We don't need to check the
Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."
And you said, "Let's just check though."
Is that what you think happened?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So, do you wanna talk about it?
It kind of feels like
you wanna talk about it.

DIANE: I don't understand why you couldn't
just believe that I know something.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I believe you know lots of things.
I just thought, what's
the harm in checking?
Especially since we have
these amazing little boxes now
with 24-hour access to the world's
largest source of information.

DIANE: You shouldn't have to check if your
wife knows what she's talking about.
You humiliated me in
front of all my friends.
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay, but don't I get
a little bit of credit
for inviting all of your friends
to an awesome surprise party?

DIANE: No, because why did you think I
would want an awesome surprise party?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Is it the awesome part
you object to or...?

DIANE: You always just assume that
everyone wants whatever you want.
Well, you know what
they say about assuming.
Makes an ass out of you and "Ming."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Who's Ming?
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay? I'm
sorry I threw you a party.
What a monster.
Throwing you a party like
some sort of terrorist.
It's a well-known fact that
if you really hate someone,
really wanna hit them where
it hurts, throw them a party.
That's why when we go to war,
we don't drop bombs on the enemy.
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry
I threw you an amazing party.

DIANE: You didn't throw me an amazing
party. You threw you an amazing party.
Everything today has been about you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Really? That picnic we had in
the tea garden was about me?
That trip to the library was about me?
"Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer in
conversation with Helen Molesworth"
was about me?!
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the
ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

DIANE: Why does my birthday
party have a ball pit?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So I could get these T-shirts made.

DIANE: Ugh.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Also, you once told me that
when you were a little girl,
you dreamed of living in a
house that had a ballroom.

DIANE: A ballroom is not a room full... No!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Heads up! Yes!

DIANE: Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must
have known I wouldn't like any of this.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: But I went balls-to-the-wall
for this party.
Literally, there are balls
all the way to the wall.

DIANE: Right, but I've told you so
many times, I don't like parties.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: But it's the thought that counts, right?

DIANE: That's exactly... The
thought was... Ugh!
What did you do to the spare bedroom?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Every room has a theme.
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

DIANE: Starbucks is not a theme.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Can we not fight in the Starbucks?
I don't wanna be a couple
who fights at Starbucks.

DIANE: Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I really thought you'd like
this. I know you love Starbucks.

DIANE: I don't love...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You don't love Starbucks,
you love the independent coffee
place, Starbucks is more convenient.

DIANE: Yeah.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: See?
I do sometimes listen.
Can I get you a decaf Americano?

DIANE: Sure.
I know you put a lot of thought into
today and I appreciate that, really...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I have a decaf Americano
on the bar for Darren.
Is there a Darren here?
Says Darren on the cup.

DIANE: Thank you. This is very realistic.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I know, right?
You wanna go check out the
pool? I filled it up with Jell-O.

DIANE: Ah.
I still can't believe I'm 35.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Would you believe I'm 35?

DIANE: I'm still mad at you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I know.

DIANE: But I don't wanna be.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, I don't want you
to be mad at me either.
We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.

DIANE: Oh, my God. You don't
want me to go to Cordovia.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What?!

DIANE: You don't think I know what it means
when you say shit like...
"We only have so many days together"?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh, what?

DIANE: "Diane, I love waking up next to you."
"Diane, I wish every
day could be like this."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, but...

DIANE: "Just the two of us, together."
Do you have any idea how that feels
when I'm trying to plan my trip?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay. You got me!
Maybe I don't want my wife,
whom I love, to go off on
a terrifying six-month tour
of the most war-torn,
disease-splattered corners of the planet
with a charming, handsome,
billionaire bachelor.
What could I be thinking?
I'm such a terrible husband.

DIANE: I'm not happy.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: With me?

DIANE: I don't know.
With everything.
I wake up in the morning and
I feel like I have no purpose.
And I'm 35. And if I don't
make some change in my life,
then this is how I'm gonna feel forever.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Honey...

DIANE: But then I think
about Sebastian St. Clair
and going to work with him,
helping people and making a difference.
And I feel like I have a
reason to get out of bed.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I didn't know you felt that way.
If you told me that,
I would have heard it.

DIANE: Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love
you and think you're a good dog.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are, and
I love your cute, funny face,
but I don't wanna be
one of those couples
that settles into a
routine and never changes.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, I don't know what to
say because I'm an old dog
and I'm not gonna change.
Do you know what I do while
you're at work all day?
I mostly just sit right there.
Sometimes I pretend to dig a
little hole and then I take a nap.
And when I hear your car in the
driveway, it is the best part of my day.
I mean, I go insane.

DIANE: I know, and I love you so much,
but you're never going to be
my only priority like that.
That's just not how I'm wired.
I need to also live my life.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well... okay.

DIANE: Is it okay?
If I change and try new
things and you still love me?
And you just stay the same person
you've always been and I still love you?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh, yeah, that sounds good
to me. Does that work for you?

DIANE: Yeah, I think that works.
Just don't throw me any
more surprise parties, okay?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh, yeah, noted.

DIANE: I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And you're saying no part of you wants
to go jump in that ball pit right now?

DIANE: Well, maybe a little.
Does that make me a hypocrite?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, it just means you changed.
It's one of the things I love about you.
