MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Look alive, bright eyes.
It's the morning and somebody loves you.
Right back at you, buddy.
I love you, too.

DIANE: Idea for a new Pixar movie:
what are pizza boxes thinking about?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And Leland Stanford?

DIANE: Transcontinental Railroad.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That is correct.
Next question,
what is my favorite kind of berry?
Barry Bostwick.
I'm so sorry, the correct answer,
of course, was Barry Bostwick.

DIANE: He also likes Franken Berry.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We would have accepted Franken Berry.
I'm sorry, you lose.
That's our show, but before we go
I wanna send out a quick message.
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you
and I know you're doing great things.

DIANE: Idea for a new app: an undo button
that could undo long amounts of time.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!

DIANE: Three months. A year. A life.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Erica, where did that tooth come from?
All right, let's keep this party going.

DIANE: One click and everything could
just go back to the way it was.
Hey.

BOJACK: Hey.
You're still here?

DIANE: Yup. Still here.

BOJACK: Stop it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wake up, captain dumbshit.
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for two months.

BOJACK: Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.
Aah! What is it?
If the studio wants to sue me, tell them
to take my house. I belong to the sea now.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Are you drunk?

BOJACK: Only on adventure. And gin.
And vodka. And gin.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: They're not gonna sue you.
They finished the movie.

BOJACK: What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't know, ask Turteltaub.
That's not why I'm here.
I thought you were in Cordovia.

DIANE: You've been here this whole time?
Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn
should do... Shut up.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Get dressed.
We're going to the orphanage.

BOJACK: What orphanage?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Remember at Herb's funeral,
I asked you what you wanted me to do
with your Horsin' Around residuals?

BOJACK: I do... not remember that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You said, "Give it to an orphanage
or something."

BOJACK: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It turns out you made enough money
to build a brand new one.
So congratulations. You're a hero.

BOJACK: A hero?
You cannot call it that.
A, because I am not a great man and B,
because that is a really stupid name.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Stop pissing off the orphans.
A lot of them grow up
to be serial killers.
Thank you for that lovely song.
But I'm not a good person.
This is the only good thing I've ever done
and I did it by accident.
And it just goes to show you
life is just... Ah, what am I saying?
I don't have to tell you how hard life is.
You're the ones with the dead parents.
No. No. Not necessarily.
Maybe they just didn't want you.
My point is,
I don't understand how people live.
It's amazing to me that people
wake up every morning
and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it."
How do people do it?
I don't know how.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yay.

TODD: Ha.
Copernicus, how do you always come
up with these amazing butt jokes?
So true. So wise.
Shan't you?
What, number two, how do you do that?

BOJACK: I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of
production. If there's anything I can do.
Really?
Help you out of that tree, ma'am?
You did all that in the computer?
Wait so I'm not in the movie at all?
But it's not my performance.
Are you actually Jewish? Because I feel
some of these you're just making up.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: We should a put a social-media desk there.
If we hire someone to micromanage
our clients' online personas
and new media outreach, they'll seem
more grounded down to earth.
Mr. Rabitowitz.
This is a place of business.
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment
for a second?
I just wanna remember this instant
where for once in my life,
everything was going
What is it?
This is the wife you're divorcing, right?
We've been sleeping together
for three months.
We're about to start a company together.
Listen, this is--
What?

TODD: Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine running,
I'll be back in a-- Oh.
Hey.

BOJACK: Hey.

TODD: Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.
I'm going away for a while.

BOJACK: Oh, where?

TODD: The Giggleship.
It's the comedy cruise line
People magazine
once called "a comedy cruise line."

BOJACK: Comedy cruise line?
Oh right, your improv thing.
How was your, uh, graduation show?

TODD: It was two months ago. You missed it.

BOJACK: Sorry.

TODD: No, you're not.

BOJACK: Well...

TODD: Hey, do you remember the morning
after my first night here?

BOJACK: I don't know why everyone keeps asking
if I remember things. I don't.
Just as a general rule,
if your question begins, "Do you remember"
and doesn't end with "how much you hated
Moulin Rouge," the answer's no.

TODD: I was so happy to have a place
to stay that I made pancakes.
And you kept eating them
so I kept making them.
And then you got mad at me
for letting you eat so many pancakes.
You tried to chase me around the pool,
but you were too hungover
and also full from the pancakes
so instead... you took a nap.
And when you woke up, you said,
"Thanks for the pancakes.
Now get out of my house."

BOJACK: I don't remember any of that.

TODD: Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,
just like you wanted.

BOJACK: Good. Honestly, you'll probably
be better off without me.

TODD: Yeah. But we had some good times,
though, right?

BOJACK: Did we?

TODD: Right. Well, um, take care.
Hey, I hope you can find a way
to be happy, BoJack.
I really do.

BOJACK: Yeah, okay.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, Todd?
You need to get your shit together.

DIANE: Ugh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.
I want you to come onboard
and write celebrity tweets.

DIANE: I don't know how to do that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're a ghost-writer.
It's the same as writing a book,
they're just a lot shorter
and more people read them.

DIANE: All right, but why are you helping me?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Because my life is a mess right now and I
compulsively take care of other people
when I don't know how
to take care of myself.

DIANE: Oh. I was hoping it was
because you believed in me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't.

TODD: Wow, we must all make a lot of money.
Say what?
Wow. No more couch-sleeping for this guy.
He gets a mattress.
You really are the master
of spontaneous witticisms.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, I am ready.
What's going on?
Oh.
Uh... Oh.
Well, we burned that bridge.

TODD: Hey, Bryan. What's going on here?
That's solid space-work.
Bryan, don't worry.
I'm gonna go to Copernicus
and get this sorted out.
Copernicus? Uh, Copernicus?
Huh?
Huh.
Whoa.
One Hundred and One Butt Jokes?
"No parking in the rear?"
Copernicus is a fraud!
Oh!
No.
No. Shame on all of you! Just wait
till you see my Trip Advisor review.
This cruise is getting three stars.
Because I have very
mixed feelings about it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah.
I don't want to do that anymore.
No. I don't want--
What?
I'm just saying, what, you think you're
gonna find some perfect unattached guy
who's gonna love you like I do?
Who's gonna make you laugh
and feel good about yourself?
I'm not afraid of being alone.
And you might wanna find
someplace else to work
because you're not coming with me.
It's my company.
My name is on all the paperwork.
I think I can do it without you.
Good luck.
My name is Princess Carolyn.

BOJACK: And as I held that baby in my arms,
I knew I had been given a second chance.
A chance to finally make things right.
And this time, I was gonna win...
the race of life.
Whoa. That was actually good.
But it wasn't Secretariat.
And it wasn't me. It was a computer.
Thank you, it's--
I don't have to thank my parents, do I?
Uh...
No. Well, define "weird."
I mean, occasionally.
Thank you.
They don't love me.
They don't know me.
Are you saying that nobody who really
knows me could ever love me?
What am I doing here?

DIANE: Sextina, hi. Thanks for meeting me here.
I'm really excited to be working with you.
Can you spell that last one?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, thank you so much.
You people are the real stars. Huh?

DIANE: Hello?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, Diane.

DIANE: Hey. Uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So... How's Cordovia?

DIANE: It's... hard.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Do you know where the batteries are?

DIANE: What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The batteries in the remote died.

DIANE: Did you check the junk drawer?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.
I think I'm just gonna take them
out of the smoke detector.

DIANE: No, don't do that.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, I'm out of options.
Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I
think maybe you should get back here
so you can help me find the batteries.

DIANE: Yeah?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I know you're doing important work
and it's a long way to travel,
but I need you here
and I think you should come home.

DIANE: Is that really what you want?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Of course it is.

DIANE: Well, okay, I'm looking
at this website right now
and it says if I leave immediately,
I can still make it home tonight.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That sounds great.

DIANE: I love you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I love you, too, Diane.
You know, it's the funniest thing.
There is a woman in this restaurant
who looks just like you.

DIANE: I guess I just have one of those faces.

TODD: Okay, party people,
we have time for one more suggestion.

BOJACK: Todd.
Todd, it's me, BoJack.

TODD: BoJack?

BOJACK: Todd, I'm getting you out of here.

TODD: I can't leave.
I need to take suggestions.

BOJACK: Okay, well, here's a suggestion,
your name is Todd.
You're 24, you live on my couch and
you've always seen the good in me somehow.
You've been brainwashed into thinking
that you belong here, but you don't.
You belong back home.
If you're any kind of improviser,
you'll take that suggestion
and you'll run with it.

TODD: Huh.
Let's get out of here.

BOJACK: What the hell are you gonna do about it?

TODD: Oh, no.
Don't do anything crazy, guys.

BOJACK: You can't be serious.

TODD: Just get behind me, BoJack.
Be reasonable.
You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.
Especially not when I have this
smoke bomb. Ka-pow!

BOJACK: Seriously?

TODD: Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.
Oh, no.

TODD: Ugh! BoJack, help.

BOJACK: There is literally nothing
happening to you.

TODD: You don't understand, if you die
in improv, you die in real life.

BOJACK: So stupid. Fine.
I guess I have a guard killing machine?
Beep, boop
This whole ship is full of idiots.
Beep, boop.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, Todd.
Almost there.

TODD: Sorry, improv is fun
and great and everything,
but you guys are really into improv.
I'm gonna go with my friend.

BOJACK: I invited him to.

TODD: It's more complicated than that.
I, uh...

BOJACK: Hash browns.

TODD: What?

BOJACK: Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off?
It was hash browns, not pancakes.
The first morning you stayed with me.
You kept making them and I kept eating
them and then I threw up in the pool.
And that made you throw up in the pool. Then I
got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.
But, you said, "I'll clean it up."

TODD: And did I clean it up?

BOJACK: No. You didn't.
I had to call the pool cleaner.

TODD: Ha, ha.

BOJACK: And you said,
"Thank you for letting me stay here.
I don't have anywhere else to go."
And I remember when you said that,
"I don't have anywhere else to go,"
because I felt good about myself.
And I don't feel that way a lot.
Letting you stay with me
was the best thing I ever did on purpose.
I don't think I ever told you that.
But I should have.
Because you're my best friend, Todd.

TODD: Why do you have a boat?

BOJACK: Uh, I don't remember.
Hello? Prince?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls
from this New York playwright,
she really wants to talk to you.
She says you know her, Jill Pill?

BOJACK: Jill Pill?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ring any bells?
Apparently, she worked on your TV show.

BOJACK: Horsin' Around?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, actually. The other TV show.

BOJACK: Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm moving into the new office
and I got Herb's ashes here.
I really don't know what
to do with this thing.
Do you want it?

BOJACK: Yeah.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Why did I take you with me?

BOJACK: Herb loved orphans.
Mostly as a delivery apparatus
for hackneyed punchlines
and mawkish sentimentality, but still.

TODD: Hey, who's Jerb?

BOJACK: What?
Jerb Ka-- Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?"
No, obviously that was a typo.
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage
to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz?

TODD: Kind of sounds like something you'd get
at a Mediterranean restaurant,
but wouldn't finish.
And the waiter would say, "You want me
to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"
And you'd say, "No."

BOJACK: You gotta fix this.
Jerb's kids?
No, there's no Jerb. It's Herb.

TODD: You know, Herb would probably think
that this is pretty funny
that you couldn't even get this right.

BOJACK: Yeah. He would.

TODD: So, in a way...

BOJACK: Yeah.
You wanna get some
Mediterranean food?
You read my mind.
Oh, God. Lungs on fire.
Ow. Crap. I hate this.
Running is terrible.
Everything is the worst.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Huh?
Yeah?
Okay.
