BOJACK: So, at the end of the day,
I'm just a regular guy trying
to live a regular life.
Uh, yes, I remember that.
Why do you remember that?
What? No.
We don't need to dwell on the past.
Uh... No.
No, I don't need--
That's not-- Ugh...
No, everything is not all right.
This table's been wobbling all evening.
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick
for an hour, I'd call your mother.
Something in that area or...?
What are you doing?
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.
Some of us here are trying
to forget you exist.

TODD: Uh, yes.
Aw, okay.

BOJACK: Hey, Todd, can you drive me
to get my car?
I wanted to be responsible last night,
so I Ubered home
and left my car in the fountain.

TODD: Sorry, BoJack.
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.
It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

BOJACK: I realize that by saying "what"
I might set off a chain of events
whereby we continue this conversation,
but what?

TODD: Well, remember when I first moved in
and I kept asking
if we could go to Disneyland?

BOJACK: I do not.

TODD: And then you said
that there was no Disneyland.

BOJACK: No.

TODD: That Disneyland was a made-up lie,
like the tooth fairy, that parents use
to get their kids to behave.

BOJACK: Oh, yeah, that shut you up.

TODD: Sure did.
But then I thought,
why isn't there a Disneyland?
People would love it!
So, I took matters into my own hands,
and over the last five years,
I built my own Disneyland.

BOJACK: You've been doing this for five years?
How have you never mentioned it?

TODD: I bought that cheap plot of non-arable
dirt by the toxic waste dump
up the hill from the old fire station.

BOJACK: Okay, Todd.

TODD: I'm gonna build a Disneyland.

BOJACK: Sounds great, champ.
If it wasn't for that,
she never would've gotten sober.

TODD: Just finished drawing up blueprints
for that Disneyland I'm building.

BOJACK: Kind of busy here, Todd.
So, it turned out to be a good thing
I peed in her car.

TODD: Sorry for all the noise.
Got this crew of worker bees
to help me build my Disneyland.

BOJACK: Okay, I get it. You are building
your own Disneyland.
Literally the first I'm hearing of this.

TODD: Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.
Finally, people will have a place to go
after they win the Super Bowl.

BOJACK: But you do know
that there already is a Disneyland?

TODD: Yeah, I built it.

BOJACK: No, I mean the real Disneyland.

TODD: You mean, the one in the hearts
and minds of children everywhere?

BOJACK: The one in Anaheim!

TODD: I think we're saying the same thing.

BOJACK: Are we?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Can't say I'll miss it,
but we did have some crazy adventures
together these last few weeks.
Honey, would you rub my chin for me
so I can remember things?

DIANE: Oh, um, okay. Uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, memories.
Hey, where should we go for my first meal
after the operation?

DIANE: It's not an operation,
but we could go to Storky's again.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, yeah! We're finally due
for our free sub.
"Storky's,
where your 81st sandwich is free."

DIANE: We've been there 80 times?
It just opened last month.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, but you love it, so whenever
you suggest it, I always say yes.

DIANE: Yeah, but 80 times?

BOJACK: What the...?
Huh?
Okay, you guys. 
You vultures are killing me!
Ah, the Valley.
Because sometimes you wanna go
where no one knows your name.
Pinky? Hey, how are you?
How's the book biz?
What are you doing here?
Wait, she just got out
of a 30-year coma
and she's the head of programming
at a major broadcast network?
Huh.

BOJACK: BoJack.
BoJack Horseman.
Nah. You know what they say,
you can lead a horse to roller,
but you can't make him rink.
Really?
Actually, I was on. You know what,
I'm sick of talking about me.
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here
with the regulars.
How hard is it to look
before they bring it out?
Excuse me, miss?
What?
Oh, yeah, I guess.
Or like when Kramer was
on Murphy Brown.
Hey, you want to get out of here?
Yes, totally.
Oh, my God, is it morning?
We stayed up all night talking,
and we didn't even have sex.
Oh!
Oh, yes.
Something's wrong.
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want
to spend more time with you
even though I know we just had sex.
No, you don't understand.
We already had sex,
but I still want to spend time with you.
Is that normal? Am I normal?
What is happening to me?
I want to do things with you.
Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.
I don't understand these feelings.
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--
Oh, God, it's coming. I can't stop it.
Do you want to go to Disneyland?

TODD: Please hold your questions
until the end of the tour.
Here we have
Mr. Todd's Wild Death-Coaster.
The name is a work in progress,
but we wanted to work "death"
into the title for liability reasons.
And this is Gabe Jr.,
the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Vincent, be nice!
He's a little cranky
because he just got adult braces.

BOJACK: You mean, braces.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ugh.

TODD: And here we have Cinderella's
magical pile of used mattresses.

DIANE: Is it a good idea
to keep all those mattresses
so close to an active grease fire?

TODD: Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?

BOJACK: Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.

DIANE: What?

BOJACK: You know I hate negativity.
I mean, I don't hate it because
that's also negative, but you know.

TODD: Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, buddy. This place is amazing.
It's like some sort of Disney version
of Knott's Berry Farm.

TODD: Oh, that's exactly
what I was going for!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I can't wait to get involved
and really spray the old
Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

TODD: Uh, I was sort of thinking of this
as kind of just my thing.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, technically, you did build this
while working for P.B. Livin,
so I have the blah-blah-blah
of first refusal or whatever.

TODD: Oh, uh, okay.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I mean, that's just good business.
We're in this together now, Todd,
and nothing will distract me from--
Erica! You can't be here.
This place is filled with children.

BOJACK: You really think I'm the guy
who busted that pinto's leg?
'Cause if I am, you should be
a lot more goddamn scared of me.
Hey! My girlfriend's here.
Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!
What are you doing here?
Look at you, all professional.
You're like Natalie Portman in that movie
where she was a professional.

DIANE: Ugh.
The first time BoJack dates a woman
his own age,
she's basically just
a stunted 20-year-old.
I'm glad I never got famous.
I mean, I did write a best-selling book,
but I'm not famous-famous.
But mostly it's just the famous people,
right?

BOJACK: I wanted to make you feel at home,
and nothing was bigger in the '80s
than '50s nostalgia.
Wanda, these last few days
have been so amazing.
You've given me a fresh start.
In fact, it almost feels like
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.
Oh, no, not me. Her.
And I'm BoJack.
You've never seen Home Alone?
No one does. It's just a magic box.
Really it's just one thing.
You can't count each individual thing
as a different thing.
That's like saying I have a lot
in common with Kanye West
because we both breathe air.
I don't trust that guy.
I bet he's seen Home Alone.
You think you can drop the jealous
boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.
You're right, I'm sorry.
Call me Snoop Dogg
because I will drop it like it's hot.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I got here as fast as I could.
Where's this next Haley Joel Osment?

BOJACK: That was a lie to get you here.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Aw, fish.
There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.

BOJACK: And there never will be.
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd
running his own Disneyland
and actress Margo Martindale
in prison
for some reason I don't remember,
you're the best friend I've got.
Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt
on Wanda's new gentleman friend.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, BoJack. What's the play here?
You'll find one little imperfection
and harp on it
like you do with my boyfriend?

BOJACK: But you do understand what my "thing" is
with your boyfriend?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You'll just push her
into this other guy's arms.
Wanda likes you. Why ruin that?

BOJACK: Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

TODD: Hey, what's going on here?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I wanted to make sure what we were
doing here was 100 percent legal,
so I called a lawyer.

TODD: Wait, what?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: As it turns out, it's not legal at all.
Who knew?

TODD: Mr. Peanutbutter.
The food court?
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might
just stop by the food court first.

TODD: Okay.
I'm just gonna throw this out there.
Is it possible maybe when the other guys
tried to copyright the name Disneyland,
they wrote down something else
by mistake,
so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?
Aw, shit.
Aw, sweet!
Hooray! Gross miscarriage!
And that's how I turned my dream into
what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom
I added to the Disney canon.
Oh, they love it.
It represents everything
America stands for.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We did it, buddy!

TODD: Actually, I did it.
I had the idea to build a park,
I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?

TODD: But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."
And unlike that other Disneyland,
this Disneyland only has one "i".

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What are you saying?

TODD: You're not welcome
at my theme park anymore.
There's only room for one goofy dog there
and his name is Pluto.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd, no.

TODD: I've told the bees
if they see you to sting you on sight.
You understand. It's nothing personal.
It's just good business.
And that's how we do business on Urf.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't like you like this.

TODD: I learned it from you.

BOJACK: If I could get everyone's attention.
You're probably wondering
why I invited you all here tonight.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You said it was to celebrate
Todd's legal victory.

BOJACK: Right, but obviously,
I don't care about that,
so you're probably wondering
the real reason.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, we just took you at face value.

BOJACK: We have a special guest here tonight.
Alex. Or should I say "comrade"?

TODD: Why would you say "comrade"?

BOJACK: Oh, I forgot to explain that part.
Alex is a KGB agent
bent on destroying America.

TODD: It truly is a small world after all!

BOJACK: No! He's-- It's not adorable!
He's a soviet sleeper-agent
who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

BOJACK: That's not even good wordplay.
He is literally a spy
trying to destroy America,
the country we all live in.
How am I the bad guy here?
Yeah, I know but--
Seriously?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I got here as fast as I could.
Where's the next Dakota Fa--?
Oh, I get what happened.

BOJACK: Could you get me a beer from the fridge?
I didn't want to stand up.
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So you called me all the way over here
to not get you a beer?

BOJACK: Why do I always do this?
I push away everyone I care about.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, do you? I never noticed that.
Look, you obviously really care
about this girl
and that scares you,
so you sabotage yourself.

BOJACK: That's my problem.
I'm too good at sabotage.
Why am I so good at everything I do?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, I got a crazy idea.
How about you just stop sulking
and go win her back, dummy?

BOJACK: You're right. I gotta win her back,
put it all on the line. You know what?
I think I will have that beer,
can you get it for me?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Why do I bother?

BOJACK: Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!
Actually, I want both beers!
Wanda.
There's something I gotta say.
When I was--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd! There's something I gotta say!

BOJACK: Hey, I'm kind of already doing--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I never should have tried
to make your thing my thing!
I just got excited and wanted to smear
Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.
I should have been supporting you,
like this support beam.
Or a different support beam.

TODD: It's my fault.
The point of Disneyland isn't
to make money and win lawsuits.
But I forgot that.

BOJACK: You what?

TODD: Hey, buddy, let's just say we-- Oh!
Oh, no, no, no. No!
Gabe Jr.!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Quick, Todd! The mattress pile!
Jump to safety! No!

TODD: Bees, help!
Your queen commands you!
No! Bees! Come on!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You gotta-- Over the--
Hey, there's trouble.
No, no, no! Listen.
Bad, bad, bad. You gotta--
No, no, no, listen!

BOJACK: Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.
I don't care about that.
Look, the great guy you've been
getting to know, that's me.
That other guy,
the guy from the party,
that's me too and you need
to know that. I'm not perfect.
I'm cynical and I'm possessive
and I can sometimes fly off the handle.
I'm not always the best
at being not terrible.
But I want to be better,
I'm trying to be better.
And when I'm around you,
for the first time in 30 years,
I feel like I can be.
Wanda, you make me want
to be a better man.
Yes.

TODD: Hooray!
Mr. Peanutbutter.
You saved me!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No.
I saved us.

TODD: Woo-hoo!

BOJACK: I want to give this a real shot.
Move in with me.
I know it feels fast.
We barely know each other.
It's crazy, but I like you.
And sometimes you gotta swing
for the fences, right?
Yeah?
