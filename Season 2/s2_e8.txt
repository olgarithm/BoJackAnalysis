BOJACK: Hey, there are a lot of advantages to
being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.
It's more than being an elbow
they couldn't crop out of
a red-carpet shot in US Weekly.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I've been that elbow.

TODD: Hello, what have we here?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So you know
how the game's played, right?

BOJACK: I'm sure I'll pick it up.
How hard could it be?
My bad, our fax machine
isn't plugged in.
Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid
and a waste of everybody's time.
But you're my girlfriend
and I care about you.
So I'm here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Good boy, good boy.

TODD: Hello, I am Mustache Todd.
Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.
But I like it there.
They brush my hair and tell me stories
about their weekends.

TODD: When it's me,
we call it "Todd-foolery."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ah. All right! Here we go.

BOJACK: Listen to that crowd.
If they lose it this much
for Mr. Peanutbutter,
can you imagine what they're going to
do for a real celebrity?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, this is Mr. Peanutbutter's show,
so be nice.

BOJACK: When you say nice, do you mean kind?
Or, like,
delivering a lot of sick burns,
so that people in the audience go,
"Nice."

PRINCESS CAROLYN: The first one. Obviously the first one.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Tonight we answer the age-old question:
"Hollywoo stars and celebrities,
what do they know?
Do they know things?
Let's find out!"
And now our first-ever guest.
You know him from his years on
Horsin' Around,
his drunk appearance on The View,
and his bestselling book,
it's BoJack Horseman.
There you are. How are you doing?
BoJack, welcome.

BOJACK: It is great to be here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Sorry, no time for idle chit-chat,
because we've entered
the Small Talk Round.

BOJACK: The what now?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Thirty seconds on the clock.
BoJack, how are you?

BOJACK: Uh, fine?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Correct.
Did you see the game last night?

BOJACK: No, I don't follow--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh.
Oh, so sorry.
It says here you did see the game.

BOJACK: What game?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You tell me.
You're the one who saw it.

BOJACK: I don't--
What the--?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That noise means
it's time for your first
General Knowledge question.
Audience, does BoJack know things?
BoJack, what is the average
annual rainfall in Bora Bora?

BOJACK: Uh, this is general knowledge?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's just an average we're asking for.

BOJACK: I don't know, seven?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wrong! So wrong.
Wow, when it comes to Bora Bora,
maybe this celebrity should
have studied more-a more-a.

BOJACK: That doesn't really seem--
What is--?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh-ho. That sound means
it's time to pick your category.
"Trigonometry." "Advanced Physics,"
and "At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter."

BOJACK: At the Movies With
Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Good choice. After seeing J.J. Abrams'
Star Trek reboot, did I call it:
A, "A visual feast for the senses,"
B, "A zestful lark through time
and space,"
C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie
of all time,"
or D, "All of the above"?

BOJACK: I'll say D?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ouch, the answer was A and B.
Though I would
also agree with C.

TODD: So I told Mr. Peanutbutter
I'd drive him here,
and next thing I know,
I'm an Associate Producer.
Yup.
I don't need a pen.
I can walk into any Chili's with a child
under 12 and get crayons for free.
Oh.

BOJACK: I'm gonna go with nuclear fusion.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, the answer is Egypt.
Surprised you didn't get that one,
since you're an expert
when it comes to de-Nile.
Quick impression. "I'm not an alcoholic."
You love it.

BOJACK: Oh, yeah, pretty good one from King Mutt
over here. Am I right?
You know, like King Tut?
Because we're talking about Egypt?
And Mr. Peanutbutter's a mutt, so...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm a yellow lab, BoJack.
You could get one thing right tonight.
Anyway, let's take a moment
to look at the great comments
we've been getting on
our second screen app,
now available for download.
Hey, how am I doing?

BOJACK: You're kind of being a dick.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, are we at Tony Roma's right now?
Because there's a lot
of ribbing going on here.

BOJACK: I'm not ribbing you.
I'm telling you, you're--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Welcome back.
Will BoJack Horseman go down in show
history as our worst contestant ever?
So far, yes.
Uh-oh. That sound means it's time
to drop "da" bomb.
And yes folks, I said "da," not "the."
What I'm trying to say is,
it's a positive bomb.
Audience, let's...

BOJACK: Did you guys all practice
before the show, because--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ladies and gentlemen, we've had
some fun with our little celebrity.
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.

BOJACK: Big celebrity?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Say hello to...
Daniel Radcliffe!
We'll find out what our big celebrity
knows right after this break.

BOJACK: You didn't tell me
there would be another celebrity.
There was no mention of another bigger
celebrity in the document you faxed?
That sounds like a shredder.
Ehh... you, too.
Hey, Daniel, good to see you.
No, sorry, I'm not a, uh-- I'm an actor.
No, I already did hang in there.
I'm BoJack Horseman?
We've actually met before.
At Chris Martin's holiday party?
We stepped outside for a smoke?
To get away from Chris Martin?
You opened up
about your fear of success?
I gave you some advice?
You said I was a true friend
and you would never forget me?
BoJack Horseman.
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So you never say one, huh?
Welcome back, America.
So do I. So let's watch
our celebrities go... Audience?

BOJACK: How could they possibly know that?
This is the first episode, right?

TODD: Hello. Serious,
Going-Places Todd at your service.
I'm wearing Heelys.
They're shoes with wheels,
for efficiency purposes.
Now I can be serious faster.
Seeing as I am a professional--
No!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, BoJack.
Another embarrassingly
wrong answer,
bringing your score down
by 80 points and 12 dollars.

BOJACK: Why are we playing
for both points and dollars?
My name is--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.
"What color comes from
the combination of blue and yellow?"
Correct!
You've earned
the chance to go for a spin
in our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And while Daniel's in the booth,
BoJack, you have an essay question.

BOJACK: What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You'll find a blue book on your podium.
"To what extent was feudalism
a cause of the French Revolution?"

BOJACK: Wait, are you ser-- Oh!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And go!
While BoJack works,
let's check out the action
on our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, champ.

BOJACK: What are you doing here?
I'm trying to write an essay.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I came to ask you how you were doing
and then to tell you
you're not doing so well.

BOJACK: Why am I getting
the hard questions,
while Boy Wizard over there
just has to know colors
and literally grab cash out of thin air?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I think I might be able to help you out.
Let me tell you a story.
The year was 2003
and for some reason, everyone was
playing poker all of a sudden.
A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama
used to host a weekly how-do-you-do
and all the stars
came out to show off their tricks.
There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu,
Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb,
the dog from Frasier,
and at the head of the table?
Big Money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Whoops. Woh-oh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I thought, "Here's a rube."
But Lady Luck had other plans.

BOJACK: You know what,
I got an essay to write,
so if this isn't about the precipitous
fall of the French ruling class--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: But then I saw, the kid had a tell.

BOJACK: I feel like that story had a lot
of unnecessary details in it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Listen. You have to pay close attention,
it's subtle,
but when he gets excited, his ears ever
so slightly flop up and give him away.

BOJACK: Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been
flopping upwards his whole career.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mm-hm. Watch the ears.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Time's up, Daniel.
Whoa, looks like D to the R
to the Ad to the Cliffe
just won 54,000 bonus dollars.
And BoJack barely got beyond
his thesis statement.
"A continent ravaged by war,
coupled with the retreat
of the church from secular life..."
And then it just stops?
Oh, that's gonna cost
you some serious pesos.
But first, it's time for
our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.
Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed
to build an 18th century triple-decker
Royal Navy battle ship?
A, 75? B, 1000?
Or C, 3500?"

BOJACK: C! 3500!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Um, correct.
Uh, wow. That's, uh...
That's actually correct.

BOJACK: Quantum tunneling.
King Magnus the Second.
Miss Scarlet in the library
with the lead pipe.
Sassafras. Butterscotch! Argyle.
Because seven eight nine.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What an amazing run.
It looks like we've got a tied game.
Which is an exciting surprise.
We'll be right back.

BOJACK: What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.
Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.
By the way,
your girlfriend has a stripper name.
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.
Congratulations.

BOJACK: Thanks. It was touch and go--
Are you asking me to throw the game?
Okay.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And we're back. Contestants, I've got
a history question for both of you.
"You may or may not be familiar with a
famous racehorse named Secretariat.
In what year did Secretariat
win the Triple Crown?"
BoJack.

BOJACK: Piece of cake.
Um, 1492?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What? No, not even close.
BoJack, aren't you in a movie
about Secretariat?
How could you not know that?

BOJACK: Let's just move on.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Maybe instead,
he should be in a movie
about a guy who doesn't know
anything about Secretariat. 

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That would not be a good movie.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I mean, more like Secre-terrible.
Do you know anything about Secretariat?
You know he was a horse, right?
Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?
No wonder my wife
had to write your book for you.

BOJACK: Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking
about your wife, I've got a question.
How come your wife flew
all the way to war-torn Cordovia
just to get away from you?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's not what happened.
She went to help people.
Or maybe she went to help herself
get away from her awful marriage.

BOJACK: Oh, was that too far?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh-ho, you want to get into things?

BOJACK: Well, I mean--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, no, no, let's get into things.
Let's get real.
Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.
Cancel the Bubble Round.
Because we're getting real.
Things are getting real out here.
Really real.
Really, really, really real!

BOJACK: Uh, I'm not sure where you're going--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, no?
You knew
where you were going with my wife
that time you pulled over
by the side of the road.
You know, a week before we got married?

BOJACK: Uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You want to talk about that, BoJack?
You want to talk about the time when you,
my "good friend," kissed my wife?

TODD: No!

BOJACK: How did you know about that?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, there are roadside cameras
all along the PCH,
I have a few friends
in the highway patrol,
and she told me, of course! We're married!

BOJACK: Wait, so you've known all this time?

TODD: Um, don't you think
you're pushing them too far?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All I ever wanted was to be your friend.
And you treat me like a big joke.
You think I don't notice?
Why don't you like me?

BOJACK: Mr. Peanutbutter--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, tell me.

BOJACK: Because... I'm jealous.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh.
Of what? Diane?

BOJACK: No.
Of everything.
Everything comes so easy for you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, and it doesn't for you?
You're a millionaire movie star
with a girlfriend who loves you,
acting in your dream movie.
What more do you want?
What else could
the universe possibly owe you?

BOJACK: I want to feel good about myself.
The way you do.
And I don't know how.
I don't know if I can.

BOJACK: I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow, um, I don't know
if I can forgive you.
But I guess we'll find out
right after this break.

BOJACK: Shut up.

TODD: On it. It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, hey Wanda.
I don't think we can just resolve
everything cleanly in a half-hour.
Uh...
And we're back.
You know, I did some thinking
over the break. BoJack--
What's going on?

TODD: Panini time. Hey, who unplugged--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, are we back? We're back!
Live television, folks.
You know, during the break,
my producers told me
I had to forgive BoJack
live on the air.
But I'm my own dog.
And as my own dog, I decided
to forgive BoJack live on the air!
Bring it in, buddy!

BOJACK: What?
Wait, what?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You're right, it makes perfect sense.

BOJACK: No, it doesn't.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That way Diane and I will have
had the same experience.
It's the only way we can move past this.

BOJACK: Well, if it helps us move past this,
I guess...
Well, just one more regret
on a long list of many.

TODD: I don't care. You said it yourself.
Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.
I really tried this time. I guess
I'll never really amount to anything.
Wow, no one's ever
fallen for that!
You're so stupid!
You had the pen
and you just gave it to me?!
Oh, I can't believe that worked.
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.
Yeah, said the girl
who doesn't have a pen right now.
Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?
That's the story of
how I met... this pen.
I got your pen.
That means you respect me.
Viva Todd-foolery!
Suck a dick, dumbshits.
Hey! Hey, hey!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, that stern but supple kiss
puts you over the top.
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.
You've earned $500,000 for charity.
You can walk away right now
or, and remember, this is for charity,
you can risk it all in
our Double or Nothing round.

BOJACK: I wanna risk it all!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right. Now that's $500,000.
If you get this question right,
you double that,
a million dollars for charity.
But if you get it wrong,
the charity gets nothing
and all the money will be set on fire
live here on our studio soundstage.
BoJack, for all the marbles:
"Which famous actor
played the titular role
in the popular Harry Potter
film franchise?"

BOJACK: Huh.
Yeah. I don't know.
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people,
it's impossible to remember them all.
Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?
You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack, we need an answer.

BOJACK: Yeah, I don't know.
Gosh, I wanna say...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What?
