BOJACK: Groovy.
Sorry, Mommy!
But I don't wanna.
Are you punishing me for smoking
or for stealing?
Ugh.

TODD: Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw
a lit cigarette off the--
Fine. I'll call 911.

BOJACK: Nobody knows where fires come from,
it's a mystery.
Anyway, I am fired up
about my first day back on set.
We're gonna finish
that big Nixon scene.
We were just one shot away
before we went on hiatus.
Usually I talk to Diane
on the way to work,
but she abandoned me to teach piano
in Cordovia or something.
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
in this Nixon scene.
BoJack gonna be in "da" house.
In da White House.
What happened to da house set?
Da White House set?
You cut the Nixon scene?
The Nixon scene is the core
of the whole movie.
Where we see Secretariat
be morally corrupted
and get to look
into the real darkness of his soul.
Is one of the nieces Nixon?
But we were supposed to make
a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.
Warts and all.
Kelsey, you're okay with this?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, okay.
Ooh, ow.
Well, what do you mean,
"get out of here"?
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.
I've been here 20 years.
Who's gonna water the plants?
I started doing it as an intern,
but then no one told me to stop,
so it's still kind of my job.
Things are so crazy
for me right now. I--
I don't want crazy.
I've got five episodes
of The Good Wife piled up on my DVR,
and I just want a night off
to enjoy them.
Gekko?!
We weren't doing anything!
We were just looking for closet supplies.
Stuart, I'm your boss.

DIANE: The first thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair
is that he speaks in paragraphs.
In his previous life,
Sebastian owned
a chain of high-end department stores.
Uh-huh.

DIANE: Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.
It means,
my parents liked the show Cheers.
When Sebastian St. Clair says
you're good,
you want to believe
that you really are.
That you, like Sebastian, are part
of something bigger than just yourself.
And for a moment,
you feel like you are.

BOJACK: Now I finally realize that a triple hug is
way more valuable than a Triple Crown.
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.
I had to touch three children today,
and one of them was sticky.
Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.
No, this isn't you.
I've seen everything you've done.
Your films are challenging and gritty,
and they're great.
I'm not just saying that
because they're full of lesbians.
There's one at the Nixon Library
in Yorba Linda.
In season three of Horsin' Around,
the horse got elected president
and we shot on location.
We can sneak into the library
and get the shot, guerilla-style.
Once Turteltaub sees it,
he'll love it,
and we can make the movie
we both want to make.
All right!
Only for season three.
In season four, it turned out
it was all a dream.
They called my airplane Air Horse One.
And the vice president was
a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.
It wasn't our best season.
But on the bright side,
was not our worst.
Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...
and steal the scale model.

TODD: Yeah, I have a question. Um...
Is that the lighted exit sign
from Nixon's boyhood home?
Is that...

BOJACK: Here we go.

TODD: ...the handicapped drinking fountain
he used in the White House?

BOJACK: Hang on.

TODD: One more.
Is that the smoke alarm--?

BOJACK: So the Oval Office is right here,
next to the men's room.
I remember because season three
of Horsin' Around was a big cocaine year.
All the pressures of being president.
We're gonna need a crack team.
First, we gotta get
the best lock-pick in the city.
Okay.
The second best lock-pick in the city.
Got it.
A lock-pick.
Todd, can you pick locks?

TODD: Kind of.

BOJACK: Great. You're in.
We'll need an expert cat burglar.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: All right, Good Wife,
let's see what you got.

BOJACK: Hey, Princess Carolyn!
Kelsey and I are gonna break
into the Nixon library
to steal a shot
for our Secretariat movie.
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper
that stands to benefit you in no way.
Are you in?
You shut up!
Hey, you got a problem?
Take it up with my agent,
your downstairs neighbor
Princess Carolyn.
We'll need someone to play Checkers.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.
BoJack, I'd love to help you out,
but I'm super-busy recording promos
for television's
highest-rated new game show.

BOJACK: We can probably do it without you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Rain.
It's too bad though because I could
really bring a lot to this project.

BOJACK: Actually the more I think about it,
Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.
It's just a single on Secretariat.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan Hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. So sorry.

BOJACK: You know what? Forget I even asked.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.

BOJACK: Okay.
Finally, we'll need a criminal mastermind.
I need your help with a break-in.
Okay Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are gonna break into the library.
But the problem is,
the place is crawling with cops.
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

TODD: Totally.

BOJACK: Now, we need to lose the cops.
The rest of you will create a diversion
by breaking into the only other place
in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:
the Discount Fine Art Gallery
in the strip mall,
between the tanning salon
and the adult bookstore.
Once you set off the alarm,
all the cops will go there.
Now, things could get ugly.
One of you is very likely to die.
Possibly Alan.

TODD: Well, you are the guy
none of us knows that well.

BOJACK: Alan, you already know too much.
You're a part of this now, like it or not.
We're almost done.
You're right. I'm sorry.

DIANE: "And the truffle-infused gnocchi
was the star dish
at this up-and-comer that will please
the pickiest of Brooklynites
and the less discerning Staten Islander."
You can do anything you want in life.
I mean not everyone can write for The New Yorker,
but there's always The Atlantic.
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?
To help these people?
Great.

TODD: Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.
One of us isn't going
to come out of this alive.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Alan, we've got enough problems without
worrying about your imminent death.
Can't we just all shut up and do this?
Why does everything have to be
a big, complicated mess?
Like,
look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.
It's simple.
And serene. And... pleasant.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Remember when my character
on Mr. Peanutbutter's House was
elected president?

BOJACK: Let me guess, it was all a dream?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, I served half a term,
then resigned
because when Zachary
had a bad time with peer pressure,
I realized I was spending
too much time being president
and not enough time being a dad.
It's like you didn't even watch my show.
Playing dead.

BOJACK: We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.
Uh...
The second one?
Because...
we couldn't find anyone who could
appropriately capture his magic.
You? No way.
After all this time we've found our Nixon.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh. Did we get the shot?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's so peaceful.

TODD: Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.
But you're also chewing gum.
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh. How could this be any more perfect?
Vanessa Gekko.
How did you get in this painting?
How appropriate!
Fetch me drink, wench.
Ah.

DIANE: The second thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair
is how much he talks about himself.
Uh-huh.
The only respite
from his constant bombast is sleep,
and even then, sometimes...
Where's Kinko? Is he okay?
Jesus, you don't care
about any of these people.
You're just using them as props
for your big-shot superhero act.
This is too much.
I...
I can handle it.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line
and I don't get a line?

BOJACK: We only gave him a line
so he wouldn't call the police.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: If I call the police, will I get a line?

BOJACK: No, we were not gonna use it in the movie.
The only thing we need the one-shot of me.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I just think if he gets a line,
I should get a line.

BOJACK: Ugh. Actors.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And I'm Checkers.

BOJACK: Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front
of other people. I can't.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Really, never? Come on.
What if someone tells you
they'll take you to the park,
and they keep talking about the park
and all the fun you'll have,
but then... 
But then they don't take you to the park.
I need a second.

BOJACK: Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh!
Ah.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, another beautiful, serene day
in magical fantasy-painting world.
Huh?
Wait, you're making deals here?
What? No!
You're polluting my perfect serene
dream life. Why is this happening?
Oh, my God. I gotta get out of here.
Okay.

TODD: Yeah, I'm going to go
with Princess Carolyn.

Hmm.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hello?

DIANE: Hey.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: There you are!
I've been trying to call you all week.

DIANE: Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, Diane.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Listen, I gotta tell you:
I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about your trip.
The truth is,
I really am so proud of you.
A lot of people talk big,
but you're actually out there
helping people.
You're the real deal, Diane.

DIANE: Yeah...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: How is it there? Is it amazing?

DIANE: It's... good.
It's hard, but it's good.
I miss you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I miss you, too, but I promise,
these six months are gonna fly by.

DIANE: Yeah. How's the game show going?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed
to be hosting a game show right now.
I gotta go.

DIANE: And that's when you realize
that the book you've been writing
in your head
is never actually going to be a book,
so you stop--

BOJACK: I know what you're gonna say.
I'm a dumb sitcom actor
who's in over his head.
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.
And I'm sorry I made you come here.
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Really? I didn't cry.
Oh. All right.
Didn't know I had it in me, did you?
Huh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hold the elevator, please.
I'm all in.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, where's Kelsey?
Uh...
What?
What are you doing here?

DIANE: Hey, is it cool if I crash here
for a couple nights?
I didn't know where else to go.
