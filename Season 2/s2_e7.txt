BOJACK: Now that's what I call horsin' around.
Uh... Yeah.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Now that's what I call doggin' around.

BOJACK: Hey, buddy, pass me
that bottle of vodka?
It's open bar, don't be a dick.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack Horseman?

BOJACK: Do I know you?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: This is my better half,
Katrina Peanutbutter.
Katrina, BoJack.
Uh, uh, no, I would never be...
My friends told me to get a prenup,
but I was like, "Hey,
marriage lasts forever."

BOJACK: Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Can you believe two guys like us
were even in the same
category as Hank Hippopopalous?
That's Uncle Hanky.

BOJACK: Listen, Peanutbottle,
there is no "guys like us."
I'm BoJack Horseman.
You're just some other guy I'll
probably never talk to again.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That is the funniest
thing I have ever heard.
Uncle Hanky. Sir, I am your biggest fan.
I used to watch Hank
Hippopopalous's Dance-Pop Cosmopolis
every day after school.
Hey, can I get a picture with you?
Here, let me advance this.
And we probably got it.
And we'll find out in four to six weeks.
Okay, I gotta go. My
wife's hand just disappeared
into that busboy's pants.
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

BOJACK: Yeah?
Oh.
This suit needs more flasks.

DIANE: Well, sure. But, you know, I won't
be out there for another month.
Actually one of the stars
just died. It's really sad.
Well, now the production's on hiatus
so BoJack and I are going on a book tour
to promote the new paperback
edition of One Trick Pony.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, listen, you big dummy.
You need to be on your
best behavior for this tour.
Don't do that BoJack thing
where you go off-script
and get a lot of people mad at you.

BOJACK: What? I don't do that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're a movie star now.
Any bad press you get
can hurt Secretariat.

BOJACK: Please. We're going to Alaska.
How am I gonna offend a bunch of
inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're right. What was I thinking?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Mm.
Hank is coming here?

TODD: That old guy from Hey,
I Think You Can Dance?
What's the big deal?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You don't understand.
When I was a kid, this guy was the guy.
I even bought his novelty rap album, The
Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.

TODD: You shouldn't meet your
hero on an empty stomach.
Want me to go get you some chili?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Good call.
Chili is nature's chillaxative.
Oh, we've met.
So, what should I do
with my arms? Like akimbo?
Reverse akimbo?
King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?
Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.
Got a momentum going.
Can't stop windmilling now.
"Guys like us"?
You think I'm a guy like us?
Oh, this is the happiest
moment of my life.
Excuse me, would you
get a picture of us?

BOJACK: Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.
Uh...
Well, the thing about that...
Uh... It's a shame that Arafat
walked away from the table in 2000.
I mean, obviously there's no
panacea, but a two-state solution
with an emphasis on human rights
feels like a place to begin.

DIANE: Oh.

BOJACK: You won't get it. Ask the question.
That's a great question.
I'd also like to know
the answer to that, Diane.

DIANE: Well, I think the truth is
worth pursuing, no matter what.
BoJack's not perfect.
There are other celebrities
who have done much worse things
and it hasn't hurt their careers.
I don't know, like Mike Tyson
or... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin,
or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,
Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...
Well, all of his former assistants
have made the same allegations.

BOJACK: I feel like we're getting off track.

DIANE: Do you not know that?

BOJACK: Any questions about me, the
handsome, famous horse with a book?

DIANE: I'm not saying anything
not on the public record.
You can just Google "Hank
Hippopopalous allegations" and I...
Oh, you don't have to
Google it right now.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane you gotta see
this set they're building!
There's a giant replica of my head,
and every episode, the eyes
light up with dollar signs,
confetti shoots out of the ears,
then I somersault out the mouth.
We're bringing class back to primetime.

DIANE: Sounds amazing.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And I'm really getting along
with J.D. Salinger.
Did you know we both hate phonies?

DIANE: I did know that.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So... listen. Some website
called "Tit Puncher"
is saying you said some stuff
about Hank Hippopopalous.

DIANE: Oh, my God, Mr. Peanutbutter, I
didn't mean for that to happen.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, do me a favor. Please don't
make a big thing out of this.
It's really not a good time, you
know, with my show about to launch.

DIANE: Hey, we are on the same page.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"?
Because you should
not read the comments.

DIANE: Believe me, nothing
would make me happier
than for this to just go away.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Great. I love you, too.
Wait a second, something's
different. I am... digging this new cologne!
You smell like a fancy cabbage.
There's that classic
self-deprecating Todd wit.
I'd know it anywhere.

BOJACK: Fire when ready.
Diane, I believe this
question is for you.

DIANE: Look, if anyone here has any
questions about the book,

BOJACK: I'd be happy to answer those.
As would I, BoJack Horseman,
Golden-Globe winning star of the book.

DIANE: I'm really not here to talk about that.
Excuse me?
I'm not slinking away.

BOJACK: I just wanted to say one thing about me.
I text and drive like
all the time. What?

DIANE: What? They ruined his life?

BOJACK: Diane you should probably just drop this.

DIANE: Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.
They don't even know how
much I'm gonna drop it.

BOJACK: The way you said that made it
sound like you won't drop it.

DIANE: How dare you spread a narrative that...
This is completely...

BOJACK: Yeah, hi.
I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.
I came with her. I gotta say
I'm opposed to child labor,
like as a rule, but there
are some kinds of labor
that children are just better at.
You ever try to fit into a mine shaft?
That is a tight squeeze. What?
Oh, man, probably gonna get
some letters about that, huh?
I'm so incorrigible.
Everyone's paying attention to me now!
Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.
Anyone else want a snack?
No? That's a no? On the snacks? Okay.

DIANE: That's exactly the problem.
Because he's so nice,
people don't wanna think
he's capable of awful things
so they let him off the hook.
"He said, they said."
It's eight different women.
Are they all lying?
See, this is part of the problem.
You're supposed to be a journalist.
You won't even tell your
audience what he's accused of.
I'm not afraid to say it.
Eight different women,
all former assistants,
claim that Uncle Hanky took them to a...

BOJACK: I know. It's supposed to be my
book tour and she's upstaging me.
Like how it was supposed to be my book.
Actually, this might
be a thing she does.
Sometimes she just whips
herself into a frenzy
and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?!
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think
every time it gets invited to a party,
it can bring along its
dumb friend honeydew?
You don't get a plus-one, cantaloupe!
Huh.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Whoa!
You know it's a federal crime to
go through someone else's mail?
Oh, don't worry about it.
Now walk me through that mail.
Good Lord, that's graphic.
How would she even fit
one of those in there?
Some sort of funnel. Oh, I see,
there's actually an illustration.
Yeah, I guess she kind of did.
Right.
Todd, I can always count on you
to give me the straight dope.
Please don't ever change.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane? I want you to
meet Amanda Hannity,
editor-in-chief
here at Manatee Fair.
That woman can knock a drink back like
a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,
but damn if she doesn't get shit done.

DIANE: Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you
an expos√© on Hank Hippopopalous.

BOJACK: Hey, wouldn't your readers
prefer something more relevant?
Like, uh, what to do with all those
extra buttons that come with your shirts.

DIANE: Amanda, I am so glad you're
throwing your weight behind this.
Oh, I didn't mean...
Yes, exactly! I feel
like I've been alone
in a crazy alternate
universe these last few days.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, you know I got your back, right?
We women have got to stick
to... Hey, fruit plate.

BOJACK: No, people don't want articles
about that. People want life-hacks.
Scarves, not just for necks anymo...

DIANE: I already reached out to all eight
of Hank's former assistants. Nothing.
You think she'd talk?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Are you kidding me? With
this honeydew right now? Ugh!

DIANE: Nicole?
I think you are scared of me.
This isn't about me.
I know who you are.
I'm not giving up.
There's gotta be someone who will talk.
Are you seriously killing this?
So, this has nothing to do with the fact
that AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-
Trader Joe's also owns MBN,
and is currently profiting off of
Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation?
No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yep.
We don't torture
people in America, Todd.
That's called one of the amendments.
Sounds great, Todd. See you tomorrow.

BOJACK: So, they hated the skorts idea, huh?

DIANE: No, I didn't pitch your skorts idea.

BOJACK: Don't you talk to her like that!

DIANE: This is not over. When people hear what...

BOJACK: Give it a rest. It's over. You lost.

DIANE: How could you say that?

BOJACK: What are you doing here?
I mean, what is your
endgame in all of this?

DIANE: You don't actually believe
Hank's innocent, do you?

BOJACK: Of course not, but that doesn't matter.
You're not gonna beat this guy.

DIANE: I...

TODD: What?

BOJACK: Todd?

TODD: BoJack! Thank God you found me.
I thought I would never see you again.

BOJACK: We're in the middle of something.

TODD: I got mixed up in some bad stuff
and a genocide may or may not
have been perpetrated in my name.
Maybe you heard about it on the news?

BOJACK: No, most of the news has been
about Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.

TODD: What? Why? This is really serious.

DIANE: Oh, of course your thing is serious
and my thing is just a dumb
feminist trying to get attention
by attacking a famous man, is that it?

TODD: Uh, what? No.

BOJACK: You eat shit!
Diane, obviously Todd doesn't
know what you're talking about.
He spent the last few days at
Burning Man or whatever getting high.

TODD: No! That's not what happened at all.

DIANE: A stranger just told me to eat shit.
I don't understand why you
can't be on my side about this.

BOJACK: I am on your side.
And I'm telling you you're
not gonna win this thing.
Also, P.S., when have
you ever been on my side?

DIANE: I am always on your side.

BOJACK: Really?
Like when you wrote that book?
Was that you being on my side?

DIANE: You're not still mad about the book.

BOJACK: You manipulated me and
completely took advantage of...

TODD: Guys? There is a very fragile alliance
between the Cords and the Ovians.
If we don't do something...

DIANE: Todd, nobody cares.

BOJACK:Nobody cares, Todd.

DIANE: Everything I did was to
help you tell the story
I knew you wanted to tell.
You got everything you
wanted because of that book.
You were a joke, now
people take you seriously.
You were out of work, now
you got your dream role.

BOJACK: Okay, yes. All of that is true.
But also, you were my friend
and you hurt my feelings.
And it's weird that you
never apologized for that...
and that you still won't.

DIANE: Well... I'm
sorry I hurt your feelings.

BOJACK: Are you?

DIANE: Yes, actually. I am.
I didn't want to do that
and I probably could have
handled things better.
I definitely should have. I'm sorry.

BOJACK: Okay.

DIANE: But this is bigger than you and me.
And I need you in my corner now
because I don't have anybody else.

BOJACK: Well, okay.

DIANE: Yeah?

BOJACK: Yeah.
I'm in your corner.

TODD: Guys, earlier, some general
asked me if it was "a go"
...on "that thing we talked about"?
And I said, "Yes." And he said,
"God help us all" and left the room.
Now I'm not sure that
was the right answer.

DIANE: So, then I called Wayne to see
if I could write a story for
Buzzfeed. Here's the good news:
They'll publish anything.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, um...
Can I talk to you?

DIANE: Yeah, of course. What's up?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I asked you, really nicely, not
to make a big thing out of this.

DIANE: Yeah, I know, but someone...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Had to say something, right?
And that someone had to be you?
Because... why?
I really don't get it.
What is accomplished by you being
the one to take a stand on this?

DIANE: Uh...
Mr. Peanutbutter...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: This game show is a
really big deal for me.
And I know that sounds
stupid to you, and small.
But I need this to go
well, and I can't... 
Those are death threats.
People want to murder my wife
because of what she's saying on the news
about something that she
has nothing to do with.

DIANE: "You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."

DIANE: Oh.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: God, you know, you'd
almost be safer in Cordovia.

DIANE: Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.
I'm obviously not
making a difference here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Actually, maybe you should.
Go feel good about yourself
and do your important work.
And maybe some space
might be good for us.

DIANE: You don't really want me to go, do you?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Why does it suddenly matter what I want?
