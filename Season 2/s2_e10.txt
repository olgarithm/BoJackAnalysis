DIANE: When she got that wine delivered
to the house,
I thought that was her thank-you present,
that she was leaving,
but then she just drank the wine.

TODD: Morning, everybody.

DIANE: Aah! Kinko!

TODD: Another beautiful day
in the city of Brotherly Angels.

BOJACK: Todd, I don't recall
accidentally ingesting poison,
and yet here you are
trying to make me vomit.

TODD: You wanna go buy me a kite
and then fly a kite?

BOJACK: No. Kites are sky trash.

DIANE: Why is it so daytime right now?

TODD: Wanda?
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?
That's what I call wind.

DIANE: Not all of us. Just some of us.

TODD: Oh, yeah, my job.
Morning.
I'm done with my sabbatical
and I'm ready to get back to work.
Oh, I thought
when you said, "You're fired,"
that was just you
"giving me the business."
Oh.
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Put me down
for a supersized "sounds great."
But with an even larger main course
of "sadly, I cannot."
I am swamped here at work.
First, I gotta put my suit on.
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.
Then we record the show.
And then I gotta take my suit off.
So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

TODD: Ah.
"Looking for a friend?"
Yes.
"Need direction?"
I'm listening.
"Try Scientology"?
Huh.
Huh?
Improv comedy? I don't know...
We're on Mars?
Whoa!
Okay!
Can I bring this food inside the theater?
Oh.

BOJACK: "That's when I learned
that guns can blow a vato away.
But calculus?
Calculus can blow a mind away."
You sure we got it, Abe?
Really? Because that kid sneezed
in the middle of my monologue.
You sure you don't wanna get another take?
Just for safety?
But Secretariat never actually taught math
in South Central.
Yeah, but--
I guess.
I think so. Is that the move
where a French girl pours soup in--
Okay.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack. Shut up.

BOJACK: Aah! What are you--?
No one can know I'm here.

BOJACK: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.
As you know, you're my favorite client.
If I left Vigor,
would you follow me to a new agency?

BOJACK: Sure, but no one's gonna hire me
after this movie comes out.
The script turned into a piece of shit,
and the director is a total hack.
Good guy, total hack.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Let's get you something
before the movie comes out.
We got an offer in for this new play
off-Broadway.

BOJACK: Theater? That's what real actors do.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, I told them that,
but they said she wanted you.

BOJACK: She?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.
She came out of nowhere.

BOJACK: Jill Pill?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: New York Magazine called her
the enfant terrible
of the immersive theater world,
and then later clarified
that that's a compliment.

BOJACK: It sounds like the kind of thing
I should be doing now.
Something artistic and bold.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Rehearsals start in two weeks.
Are you ready to go to New York
for six months?

BOJACK: Are you kidding, New York's a great city to live in
for six months
and not a second longer and only
if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

TODD: That was so funny.
Which one of you guys
wrote all those funny jokes?
Uh... I don't know.
Suggestions?
Is it really that simple?
I've always wanted to be part
of a community.
I thought you said it was free.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I am so proud of you.
Every day I'm telling people all about
the great stuff you're doing there.

DIANE: Yeah, I don't know--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."
And I say, "I'm here to confirm
she is an incredible woman."

DIANE: Well--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You know, the sound guy's wife
works with at-risk teens.
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay,
but compared to what my wife is doing,
your wife is bullshit!"

DIANE: Oh.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And he had to agree with me.

DIANE: Um--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Because I am his boss.

DIANE: Listen--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Let me talk to one of the locals.
I wanna hear someone else talk
about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

DIANE: Oh, uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ah, now come on.

DIANE: Most refugees got their tongues cut out.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Find one with a tongue.

DIANE: I don't think--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Indulge me.

DIANE: Okay.
Hello. I am refugee from village.
Hey, what's your name, Superstar?
Uh, my name is...
Coffee Maker.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ah. Kofi Makir.
Am I pronouncing that right?

TODD: Who's that?
Yes, I am new.
Who is Jan-Ove Waldner?
Oh.
Let's go talk to him.
No, I'm not.
I don't know...
All right. I'll do it.
Hello, old ma'am.
Yes,
and she exploded?
Hurray, improv! I did it!

BOJACK: That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work
on something good, you know?
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot,
even though the movie's gonna be
a piece of shit, right?
Hey, it's fine.
Are you kidding?
Did that hurt your feelings?
I mean, you're the one who said
we're not making Casablanca.
Wait, you literally meant we're not making
the actual movie Casablanca?
I think there was a misunderstanding.
What?
Because it's a different kind of pie?
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.
He said, "It's no Casablanca."
Of course you're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.
Lucky me, I get to stay here
and work on this terrible movie
that's gonna ruin my career.

DIANE: Or you could sulk about it.

BOJACK: Diane does raise some good points.

DIANE: Why? Just because I've been drinking
myself to sleep on your deck chairs
and lying to my husband for the last week?
Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.
I knew I kept these things around
for a reason.

TODD: I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?
Make a suggestion.

BOJACK: Stop.

TODD: Aah. Sorry, officer,
I didn't see that stop sign.
Yes.
And my car runs on farts.

BOJACK: Stop. No, stop it.
Not a suggestion.

TPDD: Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.
I want to become a Level Two,
so I can finally achieve clarity
on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.

DIANE: Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

TODD: What? No, improv is not a cult.
It's just a dogmatic school of thought
taught by a for-profit organization
with the promise of social
and professional opportunities.

DIANE: Ahh.

BOJACK: It's a cult. And I know.
I learned a little about cults
during that year I was a Scientologist.
Coincidentally during that year,
I read a book about cults.
No, Scientology is not a cult.
Improv is a cult.
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.

TODD: I really don't think it's that bad, guys.

DIANE: Why does anything matter, right?
Love is an illusion,
and happiness is fleeting,
no such thing as God, and all your
favorite musicians beat their wives.
Allegedly.

BOJACK: Yes.

TODD: Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.
Heyyy... Hitler.
Sorry I'm late, guys!
I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.
He's later than I am.
Is that a reward or a punishment?
Oh, uh, all right.
Well, you know,
I was actually talking to my best friend,
and he said improv is a cult.
I mean, that's crazy, right?
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.
I love this place.
My friend just doesn't know
how great you guys are.
I hate good hard thinks.

DIANE: I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But I-- I gotta go.
I'm--
Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.
The kids get jealous
if I'm talking on the phone.
Uh, okay, bye.

BOJACK: So, hey, hi.
How long are you thinking of staying here?
Just for my own reference.

DIANE: Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

BOJACK: No one is making me do anything.

DIANE: Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

BOJACK: Well, yeah.

DIANE: I really thought I could do it. I thought
I could go far away and help people
and be this best possible version
of myself.

BOJACK: And what happened?

DIANE: I couldn't.
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

BOJACK: I'd love to stay and wallow with you,
but I gotta head out to set.
Today we're filming what used to be the
scene where Secretariat commits suicide,
but is now a scene where he swims
in a fishing hole
with his girlfriend "Susie Side."

DIANE: Yeesh.
If you wanna blow off work,
I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,
drink beer, and watch old episodes
of Horsin' Around.

BOJACK: Hmm.
And if I hear one more peep out of you--
Sabrina!
Oh!

DIANE: Sabrina was such a little bitch.

BOJACK: She was an orphan. She had a tough life.
I was gonna, but then I remembered
everything is garbage,
so why bother doing anything?

DIANE: True story.

BOJACK: Oh, you didn't.
Oh, you did.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, could you get the door?
Mm.
Mm. Perfect.
What?
Rutabaga, this is too much--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,
so I just-- Ooh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, hello.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What's going on in here?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency,
and we want you to come with us.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, well, well, what delicious irony.
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Are you in or out?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Are you kidding?
You're the agent who got me
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What do they know?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Do they know things?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Let's find out.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Right--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I like you guys.
I like your hustle
and I like your matching lipstick.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I am in.

BOJACK: Go home, Goober.
Yeah! Go home, Goober!

DIANE: Goober sucks.
Why doesn't he ever go home?
You suck, Goober!

BOJACK: Hey, Goober! Get murdered!

DIANE: Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.

TODD: Hey, guys.

BOJACK: Shut up, Todd.

TODD: BoJack, listen, I-- Oh!

DIANE: Hey, whoa!

BOJACK: Boo! Party foul!
You knocked over Bucking-can Palace.

DIANE: Come on!

TODD: Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.

BOJACK: Listen to this guy, "clean it up later."
Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

DIANE: Clean up your shit, Todd.

TODD: BoJack, I wanted to invite you
to my graduation show tomorrow night.

BOJACK: What?

TODD: Look, I know you think
it's just a dumb cult,
but you're my best friend
and it would really mean a lot
if you came.
I'm gonna go down to the basement
to practice my space work.
And here I am going downstairs.

BOJACK: Hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What kind of pants are you wearing now?

BOJACK: What? I don't know. The normal kind.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?
A comfy pair of pants?

BOJACK: I guess. Why?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Just wondering
what kind of hit you're gonna take
when the studio sues the pants off you
for breach of contract.

BOJACK: They're suing me?
Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?
Because that was a long road to walk
to get to that punch line.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: This is serious.

BOJACK: We're not just doing bits?
You started it with the pants thing.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.
Remember, you wanted this.

BOJACK: Darn tootin'.
I may be a professional racehorse,
but I'm tired of running in circles.
Anything you want me to do differently?
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.
I'm tired of running in circles.

DIANE: Ta-da!

BOJACK: We did it.
What now?

DIANE: We die, have our guts ripped out
through our noses,
and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.
Ooh...
Oh...

BOJACK: What?
Where? Why?
I'm not really in the mood for--
Oh.
All I've ever wanted
was to be in this movie,
and you just want me
to put on a happy face--
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
Well, come on.
You're a network executive.
You don't give a shit about work.
What? You have a lot of pride?
Your job is to pump out garbage every year
hoping some of the garbage
stinks less than the rest
so you can quietly renew that garbage
and keep failing sideways
until you retire
to a three-point-five bedroom garbage
in Beverly Garbage
and spend the rest of your life
watching your former assistant's garbage.
Great house, great career, great life!
Must be why I'm so happy all the time!
You don't know--
My life was ruined
by a network executive like you.
Well then, what are you doing here?

BOJACK: Same thing that always happens.
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.
And now you know me.

DIANE: Oh, shit. Because of me?

BOJACK: No. Because of me.

DIANE: I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode
of Horsin' Around?
Where Olivia does the school project
where she pretends an egg is a baby.
Spoiler alert:
Ethan needs to make an omelet.

BOJACK: Why won't you go home?

DIANE: I should. I know I should.
I wish I could just go home right now
and crawl into bed
and not have to talk about anything
or explain anything.
He would just say, "How was your day?"
And then he would say,
"Hey, did you know the monorail
was invented by George Monorail?"
And I would say,
"I don't think that's true."
And he would say, "Well, if he didn't
invent it, he certainly perfected it."
And I wouldn't have to say,
"I'm sorry I left.
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.
I'm sorry I'm not the person
I thought I was."
I would just say, "My day was good."
And he would say, "I love you."

BOJACK: The longer you keep lying to him,
the harder it's gonna get.

DIANE: Can I ask you something?
That play in New York,
would that really have made you happy?

BOJACK: Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

DIANE: And if Kelsey didn't get fired,
and you got to make the Secretariat movie
you wanted to make,
would that have made you happy?

BOJACK: For a little bit.
But then...
Probably...

DIANE: So, what does it matter?

BOJACK: But there has to be more.

DIANE: Well, when's the last time
you were actually happy?

TODD: You microchipped my penis? Check, please!
Ah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh.

DIANE: Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey. How are you?

DIANE: I can't do this anymore.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You can't do what anymore?

DIANE: I can't talk to you on the phone
all the time.
It's too hard.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

DIANE: I think maybe we should stop
calling each other, for a little bit.
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.
But listen, I love you. Okay?
Mr. Peanutbutter?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.
I love you, Diane.
