BOJACK: You said if I was in town
to give you a call.
Wanna get a drink?
It's 5:00 p.m. in Los Angeles.
I don't know what time it is.
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...
What about the store?
What if somebody has an emergency
and they need more...
turquoise shit?
It's really good to see you.
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me
that's the name of your band.
Your mom never mentioned she used
to hang out with the BoJack Horseman?
Star of screen and... book?
Never came up?
All these years?
Am I the old man?
Charlotte told me if I was ever
in New Mexico
I should call her.
I, uh...
No, of course not.
That would be crazy,
to come all this way just to see a woman
I haven't had a real conversation with
in 30 years.
I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.
Because she has a family, which is great.
You guys are great.
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.
On my way to see...
Yes.
To the sea. To the shining sea.
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.
At the... Santa Fe Boat Show.
That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.
Invitation-only.
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries
and big-time celebrities and... kings.
Jeez, so many questions.
What is this,
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities,
What Do They Know,
Do They Know Things, Let's Find Out?
Oh, gotta take this.
It's my... boat... guy.
Hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, so I got Turtel--

BOJACK: Hey, Knute.
You got any leads for me, boat-wise?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

BOJACK: Sounds perfect, Knute.
Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Huh?

BOJACK: Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack--

BOJACK: In fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that. What's going on?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Where the hell are you?

BOJACK: Tesuque.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Te-who-ka?

BOJACK: Tesuque, New Mexico.
Outside Santa Fe.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Are you te-stupid?
If you don't get your ass back te-set,
you're gonna get te-sued.

BOJACK: Just get me a couple of days.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: For what? What are you doing there?

BOJACK: I don't know, I just...
This isn't what I expected.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, I can probably stave them off
till Monday if you get pinkeye.
Can you get pinkeye?

BOJACK: I have to go.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back?

BOJACK: Soon. Yep, I want the starboard
to be fully starboard.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

BOJACK: And the port to be... also starboard.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Huh?

BOJACK: Thanks a lot. Goodbye.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wait, BoJack--

BOJACK: Hey.
Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.
Why would it be weird? At our age,
it's weird if you don't have a family.
I mean...
No.
Right.
Sure, yeah,
my career has kept me super busy.
I really don't want to impose.
If there's anything I can do
to help around here--
What?
Well, I guess I could make some time...
before the boat show.
Keep your eyes on the road,
both hands on the wheel.
Okay.
And don't text and drive,
unless it's an emergency,
like you have a really funny thing
that you just have to text someone.
So, let me ask you something. Tsk.
Do your parents really love each other,
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?
I don't know. Just making conversation.
Why do we keep passing the same house?
You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?
Weird college kid that gives you Adderall?
Cool thing.
Do I really need
to know these names?
You know I don't know
any of these people, right?
If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?
That's the whole plan?
I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.
And I didn't know where else to go.
Please do not tell your parents.
What are you doing?
What happened to your plan?
Yeah, deal.

BOJACK: I don't see what's stopping you.
I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?
Please stay out of the bedroom.
Who?
The boat? It does not.
That actually is a good name for it,
the nongendered object.
Are you flirting with my boat right now?
Knock yourself out.
Yeah, sure did.
Oh, I, uh...
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...
do what I came here to do.
Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
Uh, everyone?
What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, great news.
Do you still want to go to New York?
Because Jill Pill--

BOJACK: Jill Pill? I don't care about this.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, moving on. Do you remember
when we were at Herb's funeral
and you told me--?

BOJACK: Whatever it is, I don't care.
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back
on set Monday.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What? How long do I have
to keep putting out fires for you?

BOJACK: I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

BOJACK: I think I might be here a while.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Listen, I--

BOJACK: Yeah?
So, I had another meeting today
with the Drama Chair at SFCC.
I think they're gonna offer me a position.
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there
who doesn't like my in-your-face style.
If I know me, it might lead
to some pretty zany misadventures.
That's right.
That is so typical Diego.
Oh. Rookie mistake.
Well, I don't want to tell tales
out of school,
but this Lyla K. character
sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.
Penny, hey, I got an idea.
You should take me to the prom.
Everybody loves having BoJack around.
Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.
"Does he like me? Am I cool?"
But with me you can just relax
and enjoy yourself.
Diego will see you
have a good time without him,
and that'll make him super jealous.
So, he'll come up to you,
and he'll say, "Hey."
And then you say, "Hey."
Right?
Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.
Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"
And you'll say,
"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."
And then... never dance with him.
Stop poking holes, Charlotte.
This is a great plan.
Everything?
Okay.
Cool.
Whoa, hold on. Responsible adult.
What are you drinking?
Hand it over.
Ugh. Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12?
You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.
Do they teach you anything in school?
Make a left at the light.
I'll get you some bourbon.
And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.
If you're gonna drink,
you should be smart about it.
Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.
Pussy.
Shut up. She's got nothing on you.
Why is nobody dancing?
We gotta get this party started.
Beat it, Poindexter.
It's a nerd reference... 
Just beat it.
All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991,
when a new funky-fresh dance craze
took this nation by storm.
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,
and here... we... go. Waka waka.
Now boys and girls,
if you wanna do the BoJack,
take your hands and put them on your--
God, no! This is not
the immediate praise I expected.
Or we could go back to the car
and just leave.
Of course you can. You're young.
You can do whatever you want.
That's what they never tell you
until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.
I'd say it's time to get down,
time to hit the town.
Just get in the car.
Okay, one... two... three.
Oh.
I don't know. It just came to me.
Well, you wanna dance?
You know, you look just like your mother.
She just had a little too much to drink.
Take her back to your place.
I'm being careful.
Lock the wheels.
Maddy's gonna be just fine.
They'll know what to do here.
Penny and I are gonna take off.
You don't want too many people around
in a hospital setting.
If anyone asks,
tell them we left the dance early,
and you don't know
where Maddy got the whiskey.
It's one thing if a bunch of kids
get drunk on prom night,
but if there's an adult there,
then it's like I was supposed to be 
the responsible one,
and then the whole thing feels
kind of creepy you know.
Pete.
I'm the adult here,
and I need you to listen to me.
Penny and I left early.
You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.
Are we clear on this?
I need you to be 100 percent with me here.
It's gonna be okay.
Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?
And what happened to your friends
BoJack and Penny?
See, that's not so hard.
You're doing the right thing.
Don't forget that.
Is it okay?
Or "okay" okay?
All right, that's what I thought.
You're the future of America!
Go, Penny! Go, go, go!
She'll be fine.
It's a part of growing up.
I... 
Look, sometimes when you're an adult,
the right thing
isn't always the best thing.
I'm glad.
Well, you're welcome, Penny.
Whoa, Penny, come on.
With your mouth?
With your mouth?
What kind of health class--?
Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.
Okay, that's not--
Penny, no.
No, you think you do, but...
You don't know what you want.
No, Penny, don't--
What'd you do with my daughter?
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?
Hey, do you remember that time
you, me and Herb let those balloons go
over Studio City?
Yeah.
True, but--
But it's a nice memory, right?
Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.
Do you remember that?
Well, do you still think it's true?
Me?
Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.
I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
I keep... making these bad decisions.
And hurting people.
Is it a long joke with no punch line?
Then go ahead.
"Don't do that."
That's actually... good advice.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here right now.
You and me, this is real.
You know this is real.
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.
I know you feel it, too.
So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,
but this is the right thing,
and I have never been more sure
of anything.
I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands
and imagining what could have been.
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.
Okay.
Charlotte--
You do.
No, Charlotte please.
These last few months have been amazing.
I love you, your family and this town.
I never wanted to hurt--
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.
Everything can go back to normal, but--
Please, don't make me go back to L.A.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
Go to bed, Penny.
Charlotte.
Charlotte, I am so sorry--

DIANE: Hey.

BOJACK: Hey.
You're still here?

DIANE: Yep, still here.
