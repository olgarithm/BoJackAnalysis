BOJACK: Why put the "Skip Ad" button so late?
I'm not skipping now. I'm invested.

DIANE: BoJack, you're driving a car right now.

BOJACK: Oh, right!

BOJACK: Whoa!
Kelsey, ray of sunshine.
And who's this little drop of Jupiter?
Your daughter's name is Irving?
Well, aren't you a little princess?
What are you doing
outside of the castle?
BoJack is not my friend.
Whoa!

DIANE: Handle her?

BOJACK: Way to delegate, captain! Down low!
Nope? Look down. Just
put your eyes down.
My hand is below your eye line. No?

DIANE: I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What is it, BoJack? I'm
at my dumb niece's wedding.
Not you, honey! A different dumb niece.

BOJACK: I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're not really the
kind of person people like.

BOJACK: Right away?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Uh, sure.

BOJACK: But once they get to
know me, they adore me?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: How do I put this delicately? No.

BOJACK: The problem is we haven't
gotten any one-on-one time.
There are always other people around.
Filming me. Feeding me.
Walking me to the garage at night,
because one time I saw a bag
in the wind and I got spooked.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, the only reason
you want Kelsey to like you
is because she's cold and distant.
Any time someone tries to
love you, you shove them away.

BOJACK: What? No, I don't,
stupid. You're stupid.
Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot, Todd.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, I gotta go. Everyone's
staring at me for some reason.
What? I'm ready. Let's take a picture.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hear ye! Hear ye!
I call this meeting of
P.B. Livin' to order.
I believe it was Benjamin
Franklin who said:
"You have reached the end
of your free trial membership
at Benjamin-Franklin-Quotes.com."

TODD: What a wise man.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What's on the agenda, my frienda?

TODD: Well, here's an idea.
What if there was a West Dakota?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd, isn't that a job
for the State Department?

TODD: Well, I got a whole page of other ideas,
each as impractical as they
are prohibitively expensive.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well you know what they say:
"You gotta spend money to make money."
So, how can I spend a lot of money?
I know. I'll take a spa day.

TODD: Uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.

TODD: We're in a meeting.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You know what they say:
"You gotta skip meetings
to have meetings." See ya.

TODD: Wait, what should I do?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't know.

Oh, maybe you could go on one
of your silly Todd adventures.
You know, whatever you do when
everyone is busy with other stuff.

TODD: Okay.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What is it, Todd?

TODD: Princess Carolyn, I
need something to do.
A job, or a task, or
a direction in life...
You're my agent. Can
you give my life meaning?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't have time for this.
Well, don't stop on my account.

TODD: Princess Carolyn, do I have a purpose?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, purpose? Are you high?

TODD: Only the normal amount.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I gotta go. They're about
to step on the glass.
Just stay out of trouble.

TODD: Uh, okay.

DIANE: So, Irving what do you want
to be when you grow up?
Wow.
That's great.
Wow.
Would you mind if we
stopped by my house?
I have to do laundry.
Okay. This whole attitude
you're putting on?
I must be Shania Twain,
because that don't impress me much.
Hey, I was just like you
when I was a teenager.
I was this badass overachiever
that had these big plans
to change the world.
Oh, you didn't hear?
I changed the world.

TODD: Did you have a nice shower?
I made you a sandwich. Oh,
but it has turkey in it.
Is that kind of weird?
Oh, man.
What seems to be the
problem, Officer...?
No, I don't think so.
Uh, this is my, uh... My wife...
Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca.
Becca Chavez. There she is.
Yep, she loves her books.
Big reader. 
Real nerd.
Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.
Uh, don't you need a warrant?
Well, in that case, mi casa es su casa.
So, if anyone asks, you
were born in La Jolla.
You majored in Communications at USC,
and now you're the booking agent
for Kings of Leon.
Fine, you also book Beck.

DIANE: Todd

TODD: I didn't find that
thing in your drawer!

DIANE: Why are the police outside?

TODD: Okay. I met this chicken and she
escaped from Chicken 4 Dayz factory,
and she doesn't speak English,
but she's my best friend and
the cops are looking for her,
and Mr. Peanutbutter went to the spa,
and I love her, and her
name is Becca. Chickenson.

DIANE: Todd, breathe.

TODD: But we can't send Becca back.
They're gonna pump her full of hormones.
More hormones.
I have a plan, but we gotta
get her out of here now.

DIANE: Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you.

TODD: But she needs our help.

DIANE: Do you know how much
trouble we'd get in?
There's a policeman in our front yard.
You're right. Let's get out of here.

TODD: Oh, oh. Well, we're off to the beach.
Just me and my wife, and our
teenage daughter and our maid.

DIANE: What? Why am I a maid?

TODD: Silence, maid!
Honey, do you want to sit
in the front or the back?
And why not? Maid, you can drive.
Hope there's not too
much traffic on the 134.
Okay, bye-bye, officer.

DIANE: Okay, Todd, what's your plan?

TODD: What?

DIANE: You said you had a plan.

TODD: Oh, yeah. My plan was:
Ask Diane for help.
And now my plan has been completed.
Nice follow-through, Todd.

DIANE: We have a 'roided out chicken
and the cops on the
lookout. What do we do?

TODD: Yeah, no one knows
chicken like chickens!
They couldn't say that in
the ad if it wasn't true.
Yeah! Book Beck. You remember.

BOJACK: Great news, blue-collar types.
Instead of crew lunch
today, your star has arranged
for his favorite burrito
truck to bring you lunch.
It's me, I'm that star!
Or we could break for lunch,
and you and I could
get to know each other.

BOJACK: Uh-oh, siesta time.
We can take my car. This is perfect.
Yes, I agree, but we can use the
car ride to get some one-on-one.
I mean, who is BoJack?
Every second you waste
finding another ride,
your daughter gets closer to getting
her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken,
or worse, death, or slightly
better, teen pregnancy,
or worse again, salmonella.
Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007,
because we are gonna bond.
Up top? Down low? Either one? Both?

DIANE: Oh, wow, you guys
have a movie night here?

TODD: Oh...

DIANE: See, Todd? She'll be happy here.

TODD: But what if Chicken 4
Dayz tries to get her back?

DIANE: Whoa!
Where'd you get that gun?
Just now.

TODD: Look, Becca, I know this
is hard to understand,
but I have to go, and
you can't come with me.
No, no, you don't need
to book Beck anymore.
Now you can just be a chicken.
See, this is where you belong, okay?
You hear me? I don't want you no more.
You weren't the best friend I ever had,
and I never loved you! Now get, Becca!
I said get!

DIANE: She really stretched out that dress.

BOJACK: She was so horrified,
she checked into rehab.
So, I'm kind of the reason
Drew Barrymore got sober.
Did you like Never Been
Kissed? If so, you're welcome.
I don't need you to like me.
It would be fun if you liked me,
because I'd prove my parents
were wrong to never support me,
because I earned the admiration
of an authority figure,
proving I have intrinsic worth,
but it's not a big
deal or anything. Jeez.
It's been screwy since I hit
that deer a couple weeks back.
Probably should get it checked out.
Probably should've
gotten it checked out.

DIANE: Those farmers seem nice.

TODD: Yeah.
I think Becca will
be really happy there.

DIANE: She'll have a nice life.

TODD: Yeah, until they kill her.

DIANE: Well, yeah, but of all the places
that will eventually kill her,
Gentle Farms seems like the best.

TODD: This doesn't feel right.
Becca was our friend.
No. We gotta get her back.
Then we'll just bust her out.

DIANE: Todd, there's nothing we can do.
Where else would Becca go?
She doesn't even speak English.

TODD: Well, we gotta do something.
Look, I know I'm a screw-up
and all my ideas are terrible,
but with Becca, I was
responsible for something.
I had a purpose.
Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

DIANE: All right. Let's bust her out.

TODD: Yes! Okay, and afterwards,
will you get me an iPad?

DIANE: What? No.

TODD: But I really want an iPad.
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

DIANE: Don't push it.

BOJACK: Just got to place the jack
in the right jack apparatus.
There, I have got...
No. I have no idea what I'm doing.
That was me acting. Pretty
convincing performance, huh?
There's more to me...
I don't know. Some hick will come by,
and I'll give him an
autograph for a tow.
Boom, his life's changed,
and you and I are on our way.
Yeah, Marla sucks, right?
Hey, I know terrible mothers,
and you're not a terrible mother.
There he is. Right on time.

TODD: Shh, shh, shh.
Everyone keep quiet. We gotta...
Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
They probably didn't hear that.
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.
Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play
called Someone Broke Onto the Farm
and someone just said the titular line?

DIANE: This way.
Irving, this isn't safe.
Get in the car, lock the doors.
Don't be a badass and argue with me...
Okay.

TODD: Go, go, go! Uh...
Becca?
Becca, where are you?

DIANE: Becca, are you...?
Becca?

TODD: Is this you?
Becca?
Oh, I found her!
Diane! This one's Becca!

DIANE: No! Todd! Don't you get it?
They're all Becca.

TODD: Oh.

DIANE: Okay, go, chickens! You're free.
Go, run to freedom!
For generations they
will tell your story!

TODD: Oh, oh, oh, shit!

DIANE: We gotta hide!

TODD: Go, go, go!
Hide, hide! In here! Someplace safe.
Come on, come on. Oh, no!

DIANE: Shh, shh. Becca, no, no, no!

TODD: Shh.
Oh.
Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.

DIANE: It's not your fault.

TODD: I don't know why I always
get into these messes.
You know, sometimes I
feel like my whole life
is just a series of
loosely-related wacky misadventures.

DIANE: I think that's just what
being in your 20s is.

TODD: Really?

DIANE: Yeah.
I'm supposed to be the adult
here, and I'm a total mess.

TODD: You kidding? You're the
coolest person I know.

DIANE: Really?

TODD: Yeah. You always know what to do,
and you don't take shit from anyone.

DIANE: Is that how you see me?

TODD: Of course. You're like Lara Croft.
In Diane's body.

DIANE: This is our chance. Let's go!

TODD: Come on!

DIANE: Go, go, go!

TODD: Oh...

DIANE: Whoa!
I am so sorry.

TODD: Okay, that was crazy! Just go.
Let's get out of here!

DIANE: We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.

TODD: Why was he wearing sunglasses
at night?

DIANE: I do.
What? Cool?
I mean, that's cool
that you think I'm cool.
I don't care or anything,
but, you know, it's cool.

BOJACK: Listen up, everybody.
I, famous celebrity BoJack
Horseman, have an announcement.
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges
on account of me being a celebrity.
We gracefully accept the
requisite slap on the wrist
and a brief, but
ultimately pointless, trial
in the court of public
opinion. Good day.

TODD: But what about Becca?

BOJACK: Took care of that, too.
Called in a favor with Drew Barrymore,
and she'll pay off Chicken
4 Dayz to adopt your friend.

TODD: Does she have a meadow that
Becca can frolic around in?

BOJACK: You think Drew Barrymore
doesn't have a frolicking meadow?
That is the dumbest thing I've heard.
You know I learned something today.
Sometimes when you think something
isn't about you,
you find a way to save the
day and realize that it was,
all along, all about you.
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!
Yay! I'm great!
Yep.
Nope.

DIANE: I think it did.
I think we made a difference.
A small one, but a difference.

TODD: Yeah, I think we did, too.
I think we really changed
things for the better.
