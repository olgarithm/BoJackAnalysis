BOJACK: Hey, Sarah Lynn.
You wanna party?
Is that how you pronounce it?
Ow.
Well, the truth is that...
No. In fact, I've never felt so alone--
Yeah, I got royally screwed,
know who was there for me?
No one, because everyone's an asshole
and the whole world sucks balls.
Anyway, thanks for having me over.
What do you say
we go on an epic bender?
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's get some booze and drugs.
We can clear out my bank account.
I got nothing left I care about.
Yogurt-covered raisins?
Oh!
Wow.
To life and being done with it!
What? No.
Okay, we'll put it on the list.
We gotta watch that one.
Everything was so much simpler back then.
We didn't know how good we had it.
We got to come to work
and have fun every day,
and we weren't worried
about our legacy or awards.
...because buildings are supposed
to be rectangles, goddamn it!
Wait, what were we talking about?
That does sound like me,
but I don't remember any of that.
I must have blacked out.
Maybe I should lay off the alcohol for--
...and I said, "You're sitting
on the pizza, Mr. President."
Whoa! I think I just had another one.
No, blackout. The thing
we were just talking about.
Try to keep up here.
That's not a boner. It's a shadow.
Well, I think we all learned
a valuable lesson today
about the Armenian genocide.
Why can't life be like it was
on Horsin' Around?
All our issues conveniently settled
in 22 hilarious minutes.
This is getting me depressed.
Let's do something fun.
That sounds stupid.
I'm gonna be in charge of the fun.
No, no, no! That was drywall.
Jesus, we have to start
marking our drugs more clearly.
Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.
Wha--? What the--?
Coffee, stale donuts, attention hogs
telling boring stories about themselves?
Jesus! Are we at a 12-step meeting?
So, all our partying was
an elaborate trick
just to get me to go sober?
Chip? We've been wasted for...
31 hours?
That's literally exactly the reason
you shouldn't get your chip.
Oh, God. Boo!
How else am I supposed to express
how boring these stories are?
Come on!
You people call yourself drunks?
Most of this is stuff I do
on a daily basis completely sober.
Oh, please, that's baby stuff.
You so-called drunks want
something to feel shitty about?
I got somethin' for ya. Whoa.
My name is BoJack.
Oh, like you didn't know?
Anyway, I once went all the way down
to New Mexico to see a woman that I knew,
and she had a young daughter, Penny.
Penny Carson. That's her real name.
You can look her up. I don't care.
And first, I tried to sleep
with the mom, but she said no.
Then, I tried to sleep with the daughter.
Then, the mom walked in on me
trying to sleep with the daughter,
and I was like,
"Oopsie-doopsie! Exit stage right!"
The worst part is, I don't even know
what happened after I left.
Did I ruin the family?
Did I scar that little girl for life?
I don't know. I'll never know.
And that's just, like,
one of a billion things
that I have going through my head
all the time.
So, anyone got a better story than that?
Didn't think so, bitches.
Where's my trophy, or chip,
or whatever?
Whoa!
Uh, what are you talking about?
I talked about Penny?
I'm not proud. I feel really terrible that
I might have really messed that girl up.
That doesn't mean anything.
Everyone likes the smell of fire
on the first cold day of winter.
So, what? Just dirty up the slate again.
You know what?
This may be the nitrous
and bath salts talking,
but I want to do some more
nitrous and bath salts.
And then, let's make
some goddamn amends.
Oh. Hey, kid!
I'm sorry your lame dad built
such a cheap-ass playhouse!
You know what? I do feel better.
So, we wait.
I need to make amends to Diane,
and we're not leaving until I do.
I bet they have food inside.
Let's see if I still have
that spare key. Here it is.
Okay, after we get food,
remind me that this is another thing
I need to make amends for.
Where are those two?
They did not keep their fridge
stocked enough
for two stoned people
waiting around for hours.
That's what happens when you mix
the appetite of a horse
with the appetite of someone
with a hole inside him
that needs to be constantly filled
with attention, food, and sex.
Pass the Bugles.
I can't leave until I make amends.
Am I BoJack or Mr. Peanutbutter?
Stop doing that. We're both awake.
Let's just get to this.
Diane, I'm sorry
I said mean things to you.
She's a little more complex.
Okay, shut up.
Now, I'll be Mr. Peanutbutter
and you make amends to me.
And, now, you be Mr. Carolyn
and I'll be Princess Diana.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Um... should we do something about this?

DIANE: Hey, why don't you two
sleep this off in our guest room?

BOJACK: Oh, my God, that mirror is talking to us!
We're making amends, assholes!

DIANE: Ow! Come on!

BOJACK: That felt so good!
Well, I also ate
a shit ton of Bugles, so no.
But I do feel like we got to the bottom
of who really killed Princess Di.
Next stop, Todd!
Todd, I'm sorry. I want to take
full responsibility for what happened,
even though it is not my fault
and I did nothing wrong.
Emily is an adult woman
who can make her own choices.
And besides,
are you even really into girls?
I mean, what is your deal?
Uh...
I am, and this is
my best buddy Todd. 
No offense, Todd,
but your parents are creeping me out.
To the next amends!
I don't know.
I'm very drunk and a little nauseous,
but if I'm here in your house,
it must be to make amends.
I don't know.
Whatever it is that you think I did
to make you disappear.
How could you leave me like that
when I needed you most?
No, this is not about the Oscar campaign.
How could you think
that this is about the Oscar campaign?
We had something more, didn't we?
Well, not just drinking.
Yes, Ana, I'm a mess.
Whoa! I am a broken,
screwed-up misfit toy,
and you act all in control,
but I know that, deep down,
you're broken, too.
And I don't know why you won't just
give us a chance to be broken together.
What about that doesn't appeal to you?
Wait, did we just go to Ana's house?
Did I get closure?
We gotta go back.
I know I was just here,
but I feel like you told me
some important story
that explained everything about us.
Unfortunately, I totally spaced it.
Gotta be honest.
I've had a couple beers.
Oh, crud.
I feel like I'll definitely
get it this time.
One more time?
"I'm a lifeguard. This woman's house
smells weird, or is that me?
Pay attention, Sarah Lynn.
Don't do that thing
where you write down your thoughts
instead of what the person
is actually saying.
I wonder if it's time to get
my boobs done again."
That's very helpful.
Thank you. Who's next?
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Okay, so I know
I keep bothering you tonight.
Oh, really?
I just need to know what you were
trying to tell me about being a lifeguard,
and then, I'll leave
and you'll never see me again.
What does that have to do with me?
What the--?
Where the hell are we now?
Ojai?
We drove all the way to Ojai?
We drove all the way to Ohio?!
What? No! That is a terrible idea.
Let's turn this car around right now.
Uh...
I feel we didn't turn the car around.
This is insane.
I already scarred her for life.
If I see her again, I'll just end up
getting my horribleness all over her.
So, when is she an architect?
No, I didn't mean what era.
If she's a call girl at night
and a spy during the day--
Oh, God, what's she doing?
Does she look emotionally damaged?
Yeah, probably.
That makes even more sense.
Yes.
So... obviously, I wanted to keep
following Penny because I'm an idiot.
Let's just nip this in the bud.
I'm gonna write "Do not follow Penny"
on my hands
in the unlikely scenario
of my blacking out again.
I'll just write "Follow Penny"
on this hand,
and then, on this hand, I'll write...
Goddamn it!
Uh, what?
She's drinking beer.
Oh, God, this is just like
the episode of Horsin' Around
when Olivia went to the frat party,
but Penny doesn't have a kind angel
played by Jose Canseco
to help her get out of this jam!
She's just drinking Red Bull.
Wait. Now, she's leaving.
She seems... fine.
Too fine, like she's hiding a dark secret
that's eating away at her soul.
Or, possibly... she's fine.
Maybe I didn't ruin her life.
Okay, good plan.
I'll just go pee out the last 20 beers.
Whoa. Look at me, walking good.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no! Shush, shush.
Oh!
Hey, Penny!
No, I--
I tried--
Penny, no.
Penny?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, God.
Oh, good Lord!
Will you please stop talking about it?
Let's just go home.
Glove compartment.
Oh, that? Turns out there's
a brand of heroin called BoJack.
Thank you?
I don't know.
There's that old saying.
"Liquor before beer, never fear.
Don't do heroin."
I'm not gonna shoot heroin
with you, Sarah Lynn.
We can snort heroin
like sophisticated adults.
Why did you just say what year it is?
Oh.
Yeah.
Of course. Audiences hate meta jokes.
When will comedy writers learn?
I know what you're thinking--
Full frontal.
Sarah Lynn? I don't know.
I haven't spoken to her in years.
Besides, she's not gonna
want to do this.
She's the world's biggest pop star.
What is what?
Oh! Um, never mind. Hey, how long
have we known each other?
Feels like our entire lives.
We were on a TV show.
Isn't that insane?
You know, sometimes it feels like you're
the only one who really understands me,
because how could anyone else?
But we knew each other
before we were anybody,
and that's how we can be friends,
because we're not like those other people.
The people who glom onto you
because of who they think you are,
and they think they can sleep
on your couch and eat your food.
They think you're gonna
save their agency.
I never asked for that kind of pressure,
but you and me, we don't want
anything from each other.
You know, I... I could never
figure out what love meant,
but, right now, I don't need
to figure out anything.
I just feel it.
I love you, Sarah Lynn.
Sarah Lynn?
Sarah Lynn?
Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay!
Really?
How long have we been on this bender?
Hey.
We're not at your house right now.
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
No, no! Calm down. Nobody is doomed.
And I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna go to the planetarium.
Totally.
I always forget that there are
more than just the six stars
you can see in the Los Angeles sky.
I prefer rectangular buildings,
as I firmly established.
See, Sarah Lynn, we're not doomed.
In the great grand scheme of things,
we're just tiny specks
that will one day be forgotten.
So, it doesn't matter what we did
in the past, or how we'll be remembered.
The only thing that matters
is right now, this moment,
this one spectacular moment
we are sharing together.
Right, Sarah Lynn?
Sarah Lynn?
Sarah Lynn?
