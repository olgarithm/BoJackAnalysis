BOJACK: What happened to my birthday cake?
Go home, Goober.

BOJACK: Hey, Jill.
An elementary school all inclusive
non-denominational winter day pageant.
Jesus, Jill.
And you thought your play sucked.
Well, regardless.
A lot of these fancy kids'
fancy parents are Oscar voters.
If I wanna get nominated,
I got to rub elbows
and whatever the non-denominational
word for schmooze is.
He's doing great.
Little of this, little of that.
Likes to go jogging... in a big wheel.
Completely forgot.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you miss the three wise people make
their journey to visit the regular baby?
Oh, fine, if it'll finally make you stop
calling me, asking me to go on errands.
What do you need?
That was not enough time to prepare.
What's in the letter?
Are you in the Academy?
Then I don't care what you think.
Hey I got to go do a thing for someone.
That is literally the first time
anyone ever said that to me.

DIANE: Hashtag you betcha.
Did I just say hashtag out loud?
Hashtag, oops. Hashtag, oh no!
Okay I'll take a smoke break
before these little boogers
dig into the refrain
of "Frosty the Non-Gendered Snow Person."
Ugh. Could you imagine having a kid? Eww.
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hello, my precious darling
slice of sunshine,
who I am not putting on a pedestal.
Just calling for our daily download,
as per Dr. Janet's
friendly but firm suggestion.
When do you think you'll be home?

DIANE: Uh, it might be late.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay, just let me know.
I cherish you, I respect you
and you have value.

DIANE: I feel valued and I value you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I am hearing that and I accept that.
Diane?

DIANE: Yes?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Do you accept my acceptance?

DIANE: I hear it and I accept it and I value it
and all the other verbs.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Promise you won't work too hard today?

DIANE: I won't, if you promise me
you won't bother that skunk next door.
I don't want to come home
to a stinky husband.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That is some great food for thought.
I gotta go right now.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mr. Peanutbutter,
my favorite weekday client.
Why are you calling on the weekend?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I need your help.
I've done something bad, very bad.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Put the corpse on ice, I'm on my way.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What? No, it's not. Why would I--
Listen, I was sniffing around
where I didn't belong and I got skunked.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You got to help us.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Us?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd's here too.

TODD: I'm skunked, Princess Carolyn.
Skunked real bad.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, yeah, we got real bad skunked,
super skunked.
Hardcore.

TODD: Yeah, hardcore skunked.

PRINCESS CAROLYN:Okay. First things first,
don't go back in the house.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Sadly, you can call me L.L. Cool J
because I am in the house.

PRINCESS CAROLYN:Yecch! Okay, don't move.
I'll be there in 20.

BOJACK: Hey do you mind if I do this real quick?
I gotta pick up a letter.

DIANE: Actually can we just make the appearances
we're supposed to make and go home?
Oh, sure.

BOJACK: You know I haven't seen you much
since you moved out of my deck chairs.

DIANE: You know, I've been focusing
on my new job and my marriage and--

BOJACK: And avoiding me?

DIANE: I'm not avoiding you.
I'm just making an effort
to not be in a room alone with you
because I am... avoiding you.

BOJACK: Oh.

DIANE: You know, I think we're alike
in a lot of ways.

BOJACK: I always tell people
you're like the not-cool version of me.

DIANE: Sometimes that's great,
but it also means we can bring out
the worst in each other.
I'm trying to get my life back on track.
I just think maybe it's better,
for both of us,
if we keep things
a little more professional.

BOJACK: Yes, okay. Professional.
BoJack and Diane being professional.
Doing our jobs and nothing else.
Hey look we're at the place I needed to go to.
It's so weird I drove here on accident.
Might as well run in
and grab that thing I need to get.
Then, back to business.

DIANE: It's spooky in here. Too spooky.

BOJACK: Really?
And what would be the right amount
of spooky? Jesus, this thing's heavy.
Now I know how Hilary Swank's arms
got so jacked.

DIANE: Put it down, BoJack.

BOJACK: Does it look weird?
Me with an Oscar?
I actually think that it feels--

DIANE: Oh, my God.
I think she's dead.

BOJACK: Hold on, maybe she's not dead.
Maybe she's just being a-- a whale?
No, she's dead.

DIANE: Maybe there's someone
in her phone we can call.

BOJACK: Diane, kids these days don't call.
They communicate
via a combination of text messages,
eye rolls, and dick pics.

DIANE: Oh, my God.

BOJACK: What is it? Dick pics?
See if they spell out a message.
Oh, man.
Listen, Officer--
Eh...

PRINCESS CAROLYN:Ohh! It smells like a skunk
skunked another skunk in here,
then they smoked a joint.
What happened?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well first I rolled all over the couch
to get the skunk stench out,
but that did not work.
Then I ran into every room to rub myself
on all my clothes and belongings,
to get the Mr. Peanutbutter smell back.

TODD: And then I smoked a joint,
so that might be
why it smells like skunk in here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Princess Carolyn, I have to fix this
before Diane gets home.
Things have been a wee bit shaky with us
since she pretended
to be out of the country for two months.
And then when I filled our entire house
with these giant crates
of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.

PRINCESS CAROLYN:Why buy these spaghetti strainers
in the first place?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, I don't even remember.
I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Man, married life is weird.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We're making an effort
and getting stronger every day,
but I swear to God we are like five
big fights away from a divorce,
and I do not want this to be one.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, number first.
We got to get you in a tomato bath.

TODD: Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Is marinara all right,
or will I need something zestier
like Arrabiata?

TODD: Tomato bath.
Whoa!
I am so high right now.
Wait, was there a skunk in here?

BOJACK: Uh, who's Nadia?
Now I know her name is Nadia.
Yes although I am trying to branch
into more serious roles.

DIANE: You pigs think you can march all over us.
But I know my rights.
I mean, I don't know them know them.
But I know that I have them.
So, can I check my phone real quick?
What? No.
I'm just supposed to moderate
an Emily VanCamp live-chat talkback
on Snapchat.
Let me just set up
the user preferences here, and...
you can't detain us
unless we're under arrest.
Nope, that was just a thing
I already knew.

BOJACK: Okay let's get the hell out of here.

DIANE: BoJack, I need to show you something.
This is Nadia's phone.

BOJACK: I did not know you were such a klepto.
I can buy you a new phone.

DIANE: Check this out,
the last text message she sent.

BOJACK: "BoJack is going to kill me?"

DIANE: I think someone's trying to frame you,
for murder.

BOJACK: Oh, my God, we're gonna be late
for the Bat Mitzvah.
We got to get to Brentwood.
At this time of day?
It's gonna be... murder.
Hey!

DIANE: I can't believe
you're not more concerned about this.
Someone is implicating you in a murder.

BOJACK: Hey I can be two things at once.
I am very concerned,
but also very proud
that today Tovah is a woman.
Hi, BoJack Horseman,
potential Oscar nominee.
I am kvelling over here. Real verklempt.
Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom.
Shabbat shalom to you.

DIANE: We need to figure out who's behind this.
Call Jill, find out what she knows.

BOJACK: Yes cood thinking.
If I go to jail, that will throw
a monkey wrench into my awards campaign.
The Academy does not look kindly
on murder.
Rape, they don't seem
to have a problem with.

DIANE: Be careful though. Jill could be the one
trying to set you up.
She did send us to the house.

BOJACK: Okay backstrom, turn it down a notch.
Aren't you supposed to be tweeting for me?
This is a crucial weekend
for BoJack brand awareness.

DIANE: What am I supposed to tweet?
"Someone got murdered, we found the body.
Hashtag murder party"?

BOJACK: No, obviously.

DIANE: Bat Mitzvah in Brentwood.
Hashtag Jewish stuff.

BOJACK: Hey, Jill.
You're not trying to frame me
for murder, are you?

DIANE: Can you take this seriously?

BOJACK: Can you take this seriously?
Yeah I've been pretty tied up
at Drake's cousin's Bat Mitzvah.
Did you know Drake's cousin was Jewish?
See this is why I couldn't live in New York.
Everyone's so bossy.
Also, what's with the pizza
by the slice thing?
Hey, New York,
either eat a pizza or don't.

DIANE: I'm calling the last person
Nadia was in contact with before she died.
Maybe she knows something.
No, this is--
That man's voice sounded familiar.

BOJACK: Yeah, super familiar.
Something about that voice
made me want to tell it to go home.

DIANE: It's Goober.

BOJACK: Goober.
That guy never went home.
Except for that one episode
"Goober Goes Home,"
because we were
on a softball team together
and the home was home plate.

DIANE: They must be at Whale World.

BOJACK: Okay, good. Because I absolutely
want to get to the bottom of this.
But also can we at least wait
until after they lift the chair?
Because that is my favorite part.

DIANE: Yeah, we gotta lift the chair.

TODD: Oh, I taste delicious.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: How you boys doing in there?

TODD: Ahh! I feel clean as a whistle.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, no, the stain.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Me three.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You took your bath together?

TODD: Lena Dunham takes baths with her friends
and no one gives her shit.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Gotta-- Gotta get dry.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mr. Peanutbutter, use the towel.
Do not shake.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The sauce is so sticky and wet.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Don't shake.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's dripping all over my body.
I gotta shake!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, yeah.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, look, that made things worse.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, I'll call a cleaning service.
You two get rid of the stinky clothes.

TODD: You got it, chief.
Hooray! Following instructions.

DIANE: Ooh.
Fish half off at Beverly Hills
farmers market.
Hashtag something fishy this way comes.

BOJACK: You're not putting emojis in, are you?
BoJack don't tweet emojis.
Oh, hey... you.
Uh, yeah.
Okay, buddy.
You got it, Goober.
Okay, maybe I will.
Uh...
I want to say Goo... bert.
Goobert?
No, we did, but--
Yeah.

DIANE: We're looking for one of your strippers,
Skinny Gina?
We're just here to ask you some questions
about your friend Nadia.
Oh, please.

BOJACK: Ugh, gross. Private dance?
But if that's the only way she'll talk,
then fine.
Fine, I'm offended. Yuck.
But really, guys, gross. Start it now.
But gross.

DIANE: Oh, um, you can dance however
you want. Don't do this for my benefit.
Tango, waltz, salsa.
I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here.
How would you dance then?
Listen, we have some bad news.
Your friend Nadia is dead.

BOJACK: You're not?

DIANE: Shit.

BOJACK: What do you know about Nadia's
relationship with Cuddlywhiskers?

DIANE: That's it?

BOJACK: What do you mean, "system"?
No, I know what the word "system" means--

DIANE: That text that Nadia sent you,
"BoJack is going to kill me."
Any idea what that's about?

BOJACK: How do you not know about BoJack?
I am very famous.
Alright.
Hey there, fella.
Can't wait for you to see Secretariat,
think you're gonna love it.
Hey, old pal.
Hope you remember how to vote.

DIANE: We have to go
to this Whale World party.

BOJACK: Oh I know I should go,
I'm invested in figuring out
who's trying to frame me for murder.
Are you sure you wanna go with me?
Outside of work hours?
I wouldn't want to be unprofessional.

DIANE: Sorry about what I said.
I was just embarrassed by the person I was
when I was staying with you.
I'm trying not to be that person.

BOJACK: So what I make you unhappy?
Is that what you're saying?

DIANE: It's not about being happy.
That's the thing.
I'm just trying to get through each day.
I can't keep asking myself, "Am I happy?"
It just makes me more miserable.

BOJACK: Of course.

DIANE: I don't know if I believe in it,
real lasting happiness.
All those perky, well-adjusted people
you see in movies and TV shows?
I don't think they exist.

BOJACK: No one's happy all the time.
You have to focus on the small things.

DIANE: Right.

BOJACK: Like winning an Oscar.

DIANE: Right.

BOJACK: Hey, old pal.
Look at this guy, still alive.
Hope your voting finger works.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What happened out here?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You told us to get rid of the clothes.

TODD: Oh, we got rid of 'em, all right.
They're never coming back.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You two are impossible.
Why did you even call me here?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Because you're Princess Carolyn,
and you can fix anything.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That's true.
But you can't start a fire on your lawn.
There's a drought and--
There's a drought.
So you, thoughtful husband that you are,
got rid of your lawn,
and replaced it
with drought-resistant landscaping.
Okay this could work.
I got to make a few phone calls.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Aw, thanks. You're the best.
I tell you, I've got half a mind
to go over
and give it to that skunk
for starting this whole darn thing.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No. You go inside to your spot
and stay there while I fix this.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, but-- Right, but, um...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Stay. Stay.
Stay.

BOJACK: Oh, my God.

DIANE: Ugh.

BOJACK: I, uh...

DIANE: Living the nightlife.
Hashtag feeling good about myself
and my choices.

DIANE: Hey, look.

BOJACK: Let's definitely follow that guy.
Ladies first.

DIANE: What a gentleman.

BOJACK: Ohh.
Whoa.

DIANE: Ooh.

BOJACK: Ohh. Oh, my God.
BoJack kills?

DIANE: Something tells me that's not a reference
to your old stand-up act.

BOJACK: Was that necessary?

DIANE: I'm with BoJack.

BOJACK: See what?
Fine.
Thank you. Finally.
Huh?

DIANE: BoJack, you didn't kill Nadia.
BoJack did.

BOJACK: What?
What? No, Goober.
I actually seriously don't.

DIANE: We just wanted to know why everyone
was talking about how BoJack kills?

BOJACK: Why would you implicate me
in your drug business?
Wait, I get what happened.
You resented me all these years.
My fame, your obscurity.
You made me the face of this drug,
because to you my face is a symbol
for the opiate of show business.
Huh?
What?
Uh-huh. Uh...
Oh, right, Reggie.
That's what I said. I said Rickie.

DIANE: Thank God. How did you find us?

BOJACK: Okay what do we know?

DIANE: Nadia was not murdered.
She died of a heroin overdose.

BOJACK: So no one tried to frame me.
All right, back in the Oscar race.
Look out, Jurj Clooners.

DIANE: But something's still fishy
about this whole mess,
and it's not just the killer whales.

BOJACK: Whales are mammals, Diane.

DIANE: I said it's not the whales.

BOJACK: You said it's not just the whales.

DIANE: There's more to this story.
What are we missing?

BOJACK: Cuddlywhiskers. What was Nadia
doing in his backyard in the first place?
What was this "system"?
And where is he now?

DIANE: Why was it so important to Jill
to get that letter back?

BOJACK: Oh, yeah, the letter.
God this mystery has too many things.

DIANE: I say we go back to the house and
finally get to the bottom of what's what.
Oh, this is turning into a real caper.
A real Jill Pill jail fail
killer whale caper.

BOJACK: You're doing 50 in a 35.

DIANE: Oh, God, you're right.
I feel so alive.

BOJACK: This letter is really graphic.
It's all about their magical nights
up at the Ojai property.

DIANE: Ojai property?

BOJACK: She wrote out the sounds.
What is a "sploink"?

DIANE: Did you know Cuddlywhiskers
had an Ojai property?

BOJACK: Sure. He always loved
to disappear up there.
After our show got canceled,
he went there for six months.
It's funny, because at the time no one knew
where he was and we got really worried.
Anyway, wonder where he went this time.
Oh, you know what?

DIANE: I don't see him. Do you?

BOJACK: Huh.

DIANE: Shit.
Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, where the hell are you?

DIANE: Ojai.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, hi? You've been gone all night,
all you have to say is "Oh, hi?"

DIANE: I'm so sorry. BoJack and I
were trying to find a killer and--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, you're with BoJack still?
Well, that explains it. Of course.

DIANE: Mr. Peanutbutter,
I understand and affirm your feeling--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm glad you're safe.
I was worried about you.

DIANE: What I'm hearing you say is you were--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, stop.
You have to call me.
It doesn't matter what's happening,
doesn't matter
if it's the middle of the night.
You can't keep doing this to me.

DIANE: I'm sorry. I'm coming home.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm going back to bed.
We'll talk about this in the morning.

BOJACK: Everything okay?

DIANE: No.

BOJACK: Sorry.

DIANE: It's not your fault.
It's my fault.

BOJACK: Oh. Because you're sober?

DIANE: Everyone was worried about you,
you know.
You can't just disappear.
You really hurt a lot of people.
You don't think that's a little selfish?

BOJACK: Can you believe that guy?
What a nut, right?

DIANE: I just wanna go home.
