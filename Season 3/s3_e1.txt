BOJACK: It's a dream come true.
Sitting here? In this hotel room?
It's a dream come true.
Dream come true.
Dream come true.
Just a couple days of fun interviews,
then it's off to Chicago
for more fun interviews,
and then, if I don't blow my brains out,
I get to go back to L.A.
Right. Sorry.
I am so thrilled to be here,
talking with, uh...
Yahoo Finland.
Are you Finnish?
Walked right into that one.
Any award recognition is just gravy.
The real joy is to sit
in this hotel room all day,
answering the same questions
over and over again.
Just write a script for me,
so I don't have to think for myself.
I don't know.
You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.
Pass.
Horsin' Around was not a sucky show.
It lasted nine seasons.
Its whole purpose
was for people to watch it
so the network could sell ad time,
so the show could make more money
than it cost to produce.
It did that well. It was a good show.
It didn't suck!
Why? Millions of people loved it!
Okay, I hear what you're saying,
but we can both agree Horsin' Around
was a good show, right?
Horsin' Around was a piece of shit.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Looking good. Fantastic.
You need a coaster.
I told you to wear lipstick
and underpants, Teresa.
Great. Thank you, Judah.
Yeah. Thank you
Ping me again in two minutes?
No, five minutes.
Uh, when's our call
with BoJack and Spanakopita?
What?

DIANE: And that is my opinion on the Octomom.
Remember Octomom?
What? You know who was good at stallin'
was Joseph Stalin. 

BOJACK: If anything,
Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.
Get your head out of your ass.

DIANE: He also had a city named after him.
Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn,
who's been here the whole time?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, buddy.
How was your first big day
at the press junket?

BOJACK: It was endless. It was like
the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.

DIANE: The movie's tracking really well
on social.
New media impressions are up
23 percent across platforms.
Oh, I have no idea.
I assumed you would know.
But I keep tweeting things
and they keep getting retweeted,
so we're doing something right.
Yesterday I dropped my phone
in the bathroom
which made BoJack's Instagram
post a picture of the floor,
with the caption "spujb."
That got 4000 likes.

BOJACK: I am exhausted.
Being a movie star is the hardest job.
And we get no recognition.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, you're gonna love this.
I pulled some strings at Manatee Fair
and set up an interview tomorrow night.
Relax. It's not that big a deal.
Listen, Moussaka...

BOJACK: Ladies, please.
There's plenty of BoJack to go around.
I can do all the bullshit things
Ana's scheduled for me in the morning
and still have time for Princess Carolyn's
bullshit thing tomorrow night.
Now, pajamas.
Todd?!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What is going on over there?

TODD: Where am I? Bagels? Pizza?
Hipsters? Urine?
Am I in Minneapolis?

BOJACK: What? No, you're in New York.
Follow-up- why are you in New York?

TODD: Beats me. Sometimes I just am places.

BOJACK: I can't get to sleep. Oh, God.
Yeah, that'll do it.

TODD: Is my name Sarah Koenig?
Because I'm about to get cereal.
I am the queen.
Follow me, citizens.
There are no sad times
in our cave of possibilities.

BOJACK: You better not have gotten
your failure stink
all over my important movie star clothes.

TODD: Ohh...

BOJACK: I didn't mean that.
You're my friend
and you don't stink of failure.
Your stink is one of good intentions
and youthful exuberance.

TODD: Hooray, compliment!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, fish! Guys, hold on,
I have to make a quick call.

BOJACK: What? You're already on a call.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Sorry.
Please hold.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's your agent!
I wanted to remind you
of your meeting with Pinky today.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I think I'm already in it.

BOJACK: Do I need to be on this call still?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Sorry I put you on conference. How do I...?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack Horseman, is that you?!

BOJACK: Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey buddy, loved that bathroom floor pic
you posted yesterday.
Spujb! Classic BoJack.
We should get together sometime
and take a selfie.

BOJACK: I'd love to, buddy,
but I'm kinda in New York right now.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: New York City?!
They make such great salsa.

DIANE: I'm here too, honey.
Have a great meeting!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane?! Wait, you went to New York?

DIANE: Oh no. I'm just on--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Why wouldn't you tell me?
How long are you-- I'm not accusing.
I just... I feel safer when I know
that I know where you are.

DIANE: I affirm your feelings...

BOJACK: I don't want to--

DIANE: ...your feelings have value,
but I'm not in New York,
I'm just on the conference call.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Guys, can we...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I feel heard.

DIANE: I hear that you feel heard.

BOJACK: What the hell is happening?

TODD: Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm in New York!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What?!

TODD: As Carrie from
Sex and the City might say...
I'm Carrie.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd? In the naked city?
That is going to lead
to some wackiness. You mark my words.
Would you guys literally mark my words?
I do want to refer back to this later on.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Got to go.
It's always "Rabbit, Run" with this guy.
Right?
Oh, yeah. Somebody did their research
on J.D. Salinger.

TODD: What's Updike?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Not much, dyke, what's up with you?
Is "dyke" an okay thing to say now?
Has it been reclaimed?
I honestly can't keep track.

BOJACK: Who are you asking?

TODD: Wow! BoJack and Todd in the Big Apple.
I want to find one of those fortune
telling robots that can make me big!

TODD: You don't need to patronize me.
But, yeah, I can do that important job.

BOJACK: Don't get lost, buddy!

TODD: I'm not gonna get lost.
The city's on a grid, why would I get...
Oh, no.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hello? Are you still there?
They may have hung up.
What happened to Wanda?
Oh, God!
Oh, good.
Oh, God!
Oh, good.
Oh, God!

BOJACK: Just coffee.
Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.
Thank you, Jill.
Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talked
to him since the show was canceled.
I'm sure he's fine.
I mean, who returns calls?
Fine. Listen, about the play...
Right.
Okay.
Boy, did New York do a number on you.
I'll stop you there.
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.
I'm still recovering
from being birthed the first time.
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things
that are challenging,
or edgy, or covered in milk.
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.
I want to do things that connect
with people, things that last.
No, I know, but see, years after I die,
people will still be able
to see me in Secretariat.
And then...
I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.
Then my life will have meaning.
I don't know!
Two hours long without an intermission?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm sorry.
Let me just send this one email...
What? Why isn't it sending? Judah!
What? No!
Uh...
Oh...
Oh, I don't know why
I thought I could do this.
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.
Okay.
Oh. Like Jerry Maguire.
The part where Tom Cruise's agent
got him a massive payday
for being in Jerry Maguire.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Princess Carolyn?!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Listen, kid, tough break about
the Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities
Whatever, Whatever, Whatever,
but what are we gonna do next?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I was looking forward
to taking some time off.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?
That is the worst idea I've ever heard.
You're the biggest name in TV right now.
and every network would love to air
your next project.
Why don't you get off your lazy keister
and come up with some TV ideas
and make us all billionaires?
Go get us some money.
Go get it, boy. You can do it!
Go! Atta boy!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: There's my favorite accountant!
Great news! P.B. Livin' is back...
...in business!
Yes!
Here we go!
It's gonna be great, as it always is,
from my perspective.

BOJACK: What do you mean, "What's next?"
Why does everything have to have a next?
If you want the real BoJack,
there's already been a whole book written about that.
Who's BoJack now? BoJack is just...
He's a guy who could use a drink,
that's who!
Should we order alcohol?
Trust me, you do not want me
to do this sober.
You don't need to micromanage
everything, okay? I'm not your puppet.
Gar√ßon, dos whiskey sours, por favor?
Actually, make it tres.
And whatever the lady wants.
She's a human, but yes.
Again, a human.
But I like where you're going with this.
It made you wet?!
Oh, okay.
Uh...

TODD: When I first came to New York
I was young, full of hope.
But you get lost in this town.
One day you look in the mirror
and think to yourself,
"Who is this sad, broken man?"
No, don't!

BOJACK: The first thing you notice about BoJack
is he's got a nice buzz going.
What the hell does that mean?
Okay! A manatee and a horse
making out with each other.
Just like in nature.
Remember that episode of Horsin' Around
where Sabrina wanted to be a mermaid?
I'm pretty sure
that never happened on the show.
And they're off!
Yeah. 
But I don't need you to talk.
What?
Sorry, I just... Give me a minute.
No, no, just...
Why did you say
that thing about the boat?
Just forget it. You ruined it.
There's nothing to talk about.
It was a misunderstanding, that's all.
She just walked in
at the worst possible...
It-- It wasn't my fault, uh, right?
On the boat, there was a girl.
In New Mexico.
And she trusted me.
I keep asking myself
if her mother didn't walk in,
would I have done it?
And part of me is sure
that I-- I couldn't.
But another part knows that's a lie.
How do you make something right
when you've made it so wrong
you can never go back?
Yeah.
All my life that's all I've ever done.
What's it gotten me?
I'm not even in it. That's not me.
I was digitally replaced.
Special effects. None of it's me.
I shouldn't even be here.
Oh, shit.

DIANE: BoJack?
It's 4:00 am.

BOJACK: No, it's 7:00. I'm in New York.
I'm calling from the future.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Is that BoJack Horseman?
What is this, a crossover episode?

DIANE: What do you want?

BOJACK: Let's say, hypothetically,
you had some information about me.
You were gonna write about it,
I wanted to stop you
before you could get it published.
What would be a smart thing
I could do in that situation
that would change your mind?

DIANEL Are we fighting about the book again?
I don't remember
where we left off last time.

BOJACK: No. Diane, not everything is about you.
For once, I have a problem,
I need your help.

DIANE: Okay, walk me through it again?

BOJACK: I don't have time!
It's already three hours later here!
Thanks a lot. Once again,
you've been no help whatsoever.
Spoiler from the future, you suck.
Sorry, you don't suck. I'm just...
very stressed out right now. Bye.
Oh, come on, come on.
But I haven't even--
But...

TODD: BoJack!

BOJACK: Huh?

TODD: There you are. Stay right there.
You will not believe the night I had.
This city will eat you alive.

BOJACK: Did you get the ice?

TODD: I'll be right back.
I'm lost again!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right, Oxnard.
We are looking at
a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Too bad Todd's not here.
He's always the best
at coming up with ideas
that at first might seem terrible...
Go on.
Hah! That is so me!
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?
That is a brilliant idea!
Put that in the maybe pile.
Right now, we need to focus
on TV shows.
That's it! Todd, you've done it again.
Oxnard, I want you to buy out
the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.
I'm putting all my money
in spaghetti strainers for this show.
Don't ask me. It's your idea.

BOJACK: What did you do?
Ana...
There-- There was a moment
back at the hotel where...
I really thought I blew it,
I was scared it was all over, and--
And then after, I was relieved.
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.
I don't know if I want to. I'm not in
the movie.
I was in New Mexico.
What is my story?
Yes, I do.
Being Secretariat
isn't just about running fast.
Secretariat's a state of mind.
It's about doing the right thing,
standing up for yourself.
Why, I look around and I see
a whole room full of Secretariats.
You are Secretariat.
And you are Secretariat.
And you... are Secretariat.
Well yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.
I always knew I was more
than just a dumb TV actor.
Even if other people
didn't always know that.
Seriously, though...
that TV show...
it wasn't me.
This movie is me.
And I can't tell you how great it feels
to finally be doing
the kind of work that I can be proud of.
