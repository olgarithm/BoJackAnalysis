TODD: Hey, buddy, big day.

BOJACK: No.

TODD: Big premiere day.

BOJACK: Stop.

TODD: Secretariat in theaters now.
How exciting.

BOJACK: Please stop.

TODD: People are seeing your movie,
forming opinions, judging you,
all over the country.

BOJACK: What are you doing?

TODD: Or not. Maybe nobody's seeing it.
Wouldn't it be weird
if literally nobody saw your movie?

BOJACK: How do I get out of this conversation?

TODD: Just think: by this time tomorrow,
we'll know if it's a hit or a flop.
The air crackles with possibilities.

BOJACK: Oh, good lord. 

TODD: Uh-oh.

BOJACK: It's all over. My career is gone.

TODD: I'm sure it's going to be fine.
Wasn't Secretariat a big hit
at the Pacific Ocean Film Festival?
Critics called it,
"Gurgle glub glub blub blub."

BOJACK: Festivals don't matter, Todd.
It's so you can get some leaves
on your poster.
But this is the real world now.
If this doesn't hit big this weekend--
It's-- Oh! Oh, God. 

TODD: Oh, no!
BoJack, it's gonna be okay.

PRINCESS CAROLYN:  BoJack, the East Coast box office is in.
Secretariat is, wait for it...
a huge success!

BOJACK: Why would you make me wait for it?
That was a terrible time
for a "wait for it."

PRINCESS CAROLYN:  Do you know what this means?
You're no longer just some TV actor
they threw into a movie,
you're a bona fide movie...
wait for it, star.
BoJack, how do you feel?

BOJACK: Awesome.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We defy odds,
we face challenges with valor,
and we never give in.
For those reasons, and many more,
our love is like the team
that inspired the movie Cool Runnings.
If I may borrow
that film's promotional tag line,
"Jamaican Bobsledders?"
That's right, Diane.
"Jamaican bobsledders."
Thank you, Dr. Janet,
for Jamaican me open up like that.

DIANE: Mr. Peanutbutter, I think you are great.
I'm sorry.
I'm not always good at using words
to describe emotions.
Writer/social media coordinator/
director of New Media Outreach.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's the very blade of the bobsled.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Not "tooth" shabby, Judah.
Yeah, what's up?
Are you asking for a raise?
Well, then, it's settled.
A night off?
When's the last time that happened?
Get me a date for tonight.
Make that three dates.
Who knows when I'll get another night off?

BOJACK: Excuse me, my good man.
My movie, starring me,
the movie star, just opened.
We'd like to sit at the bar.
Drinks on the house.
Yeah. Beat it, Kiefer.

TODD: Wow!
They love you here.

BOJACK: Everybody loves a movie star, Todd.
I'm gonna get a lot of love.
I want you by my side,
soaking up the spillover
and feasting on my discarded leftovers.

TODD: Sounds great, Boj.

BOJACK: Tonight, we're riding
a rocket straight into the sun.
And you're not getting left on the launchpad
just because nobody knows your name.

BOJACK: I think you mean BoJack.
BoJack Horseman.

TODD: Emily.

BOJACK: No, BoJack. Why do people keep
saying names that aren't my name?

TODD: Thanks. What brings you here?

BOJACK: Why is everybody not talking about me
for a moment? This is concerning.
Yeah, duh.
You mean Horsin' Around?
Thank you?
Yeah, I got it.
You're being very clear.
Okay you don't have to keep--
Thanks. I love you.
By which I mean, you're terrible.
Wait, did you say there's a wedding?
Whoa! We gotta crash that.
Boring regular people love it
when movie stars show up
and drink their alcohol.
They jizz their pants for that shit.

TODD: I don't know, BoJack.

BOJACK: I'm sorry, Todd. Are you a movie star?

TODD: I did narrate a Mazda commercial.
Funny story how that came together.

BOJACK: Todd this is not the time for one
of your weird stories that go nowhere.
We've got a wedding to crash.

DIANE: It just doesn't come easy for me,
like it does for you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Communication is a process.
That's why we're going to Dr. Janet.
That, and there was a Groupon.

DIANE: You had a model growing up.
You had a house filled with love, 
parents who said nice things to you,
and the beautiful verdant hillsides
of the Labrador Peninsula.
I didn't have Diane Peninsula.
I had the Isthmus of Assholes.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I keep telling you
we should go visit the old country.
You'd love it up there.
There's so much to smell.

DIANE: That's weird.
I just got a text from Alexi Brosefino.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The famous movie star and man about town?

DIANE: He wants me to come to his house
and party with his friends.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The Snatch Batch?
Alexi Brosefino wants you to party
with the Snatch Batch?

DIANE: He's one of our clients.
I met him a couple weeks ago.
We talked about me
Instagramming one of his parties.
I didn't think he actually wanted me
to do it tonight.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, wait. Tonight?
I hoped we could snuggle up
on the couch and watch Bones.

DIANE: I don't think that show's about
what you think it's about.
Besides, I have to go.
It's for work. I'm sorry.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's fine. But you'll call me
if you're out late, right?

DIANE: Yes. I'll call you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay. Have a good time.

DIANE: Ugh! I'm sure I won't.
Cool guys like that
take me back to high school
and I end up feeling
like a huge nerd over again.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The only kind of nerd you should feel like
is hon-nerd that he selected you.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Reservations?
You actually got me three dates?
I was joking.
Well I can't go on three dates.
Can we reschedule two of them?

BOJACK: Buenas noches, amigos.
Let's get blasted. Right?

DIANE: I'm Diane.
I work for Princess Carolyn.
You texted me to come hang out
with you and your friends.
I'm running out of things to say.
Holy shit. Is that a Klimt?
Ah, the famous Snatch Batch.
Good one.
Yeah, except for Shitshow, right?
I am so sorry, Shitshow.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Uh-huh.
Yes, actually. I'm an agent.

BOJACK: Thank you, thank you.
Let's get to the reason we're here.
And no, Uncle George,
I don't mean the chocolate fountain.
You know, I don't know
Karen and Taneisha super well,
but I do know how precious and rare it is
to find that one missing puzzle piece
who completes you.
And when you know, you know.
You know?
So congrats to the happy couple
for knowing.
Okay, as they say in the movie business,
"That's a wrap on BoJack."
Let's hear it
from some of these bridesmaids.

TODD: That's terrifying.
Which app is that?
You know what would solve
a lot of problems?
If there was a ride-share app for women
that only had women drivers.
You know what else would be cool?
A miniature cupcake gun,
so you could shoot tiny cupcakes
into your mouth.
"Uh-oh! Is that guy
trying to kill himself?"
"Nope, just a cupcake gun."
Which one?

DIANE: That's incredible.
Oh, drug taking. That's cool. I'm cool.
What is this, Molly?
What's Gush?
No, no, I can hang. Let's do drugs.
Let's put the drug in my mouth,
so I can trip or roll or gush or--
Here we go.
Oh, it doesn't hit right away, does it?
Okay.
So how'd you guys meet Shitshow?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yes.
I always say, there's more than one way
for a cat... you know, to have skin.
What makes you think
I don't want to have children?
Since when are you an expert
on who can and cannot have children?
Ecch! Not if you were the last albino
rhino gyno on the planet.
Oh, great. You're also a wine addict.

BOJACK: Oh, yeah!

TODD: You really know what you're talking about.
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing for you,
but I actually don't have a girlfriend.
That's a really weird assumption
for you to make.
You look really dumb right now.
Ohh.

BOJACK: Hey, Todd, you must be a real cool dude
if a movie star wants to hang out
with you for no reason.
Just wanted to give you
a key to the room I booked,
which nobody is in right now.
Winkity dinkity.

TODD: BoJack.

BOJACK: Maybe you two
should just go see if the bed works.
A lot of these rooms have faulty beds.

TODD: Uh, yeah.
Okay, let me just finish
this cocktail real quick. 

BOJACK: All right, Todd. Yeah, go.

TODD: Ahh! Cool, I'm just gonna get
one or two more drinks
and then we'll go check out that bed.

BOJACK: Uh...
Oh, boy.
Uh...

DIANE: I don't think it's working.
Am I doing this wrong?
Am I doing drugs wrong?
"That piece"?
What?
That's funny.
You have two friends named Diane.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny
if you tried to text Cool Sexy Diane,
but then instead you texted
Regular Boring Diane by mistake?
And then I showed up
and you were like, "Who's this chick?"
All night, I'd be hanging out with you,
thinking I was one of the gang,
but it was just a big mistake
because you meant to text--
Oh, shit, that's exactly what happened.
Whoa.
Oh, shit. It's hitting. I gotta go.
I get it, okay?
You're the cool kids. I'm the nerd.
I should have known.
Everyone knows I don't belong there.
Yeah?
I just took one pill.
My jeans feel amazing right now.
I feel so much love.
I got to tell someone.
No. I got to go home.
I got to tell my husband.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You've got to be kidding me.
And you're a mouse.
Let's not waste each other's time
and cut right to the chase.
It was nice to meet you, uh...?
If I have one more bad date...
Hmm.

BOJACK: Wow. Weird turn of events, huh?
Nobody's fault, right?
I'm gonna jet.
Yeah, talking sense into people
isn't really my thing.
In fact, I'm better at the opposite.
I once got Nic Cage to buy
Charlie Chaplin's mustache on eBay.
That was his last ten bucks.

TODD: Uh... hey, laundry cart.
Want to hide in sheets
and pretend we're ghosts?
I don't know, Emily.
Uh, you're pretty drunk.
Oh, well, I'm pretty drunk.
Maybe I should just go to bed.
I'm, uh, I'm feeling kind of sick.
But, hey, it was really great seeing you.
Yeah, yeah, good night.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, this is me.
It's the best non-date I've ever had.
A date.
I'd like that.
Oh.
No, you're great.
It's just running an agency
doesn't give me a lot of nights off.
Oh, thanks.

BOJACK: Hey, Taneisha?
Stop doing that.
Nobody should be thinking
about the things I say.
Taneisha, nobody completes anybody.
That's not a real thing.
If you're lucky enough to find someone
you can halfway tolerate,
sink your nails in and don't let go,
no matter what.
Yes, thank you, exactly. Settle.
Because otherwise you're just gonna
get older, and harder, and more alone.
And you're gonna do everything you can
to fill that hole, with friends,
and your career, and meaningless sex,
but the hole doesn't get filled.
One day, you're gonna look around
and you're going to realize
that everybody loves you,
but nobody likes you.
And that is the loneliest feeling
in the world.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Bones.

DIANE: Mr. Peabut Nutter.
Mr. Peeper Number.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane? Are you okay?

DIANE: The drugs have something to say.
And even though they are drugs,
they come from science,
so let's give a listen.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay.

DIANE: I know I don't always have
the right words,
I don't always have the right feelings,
but I love you so much
and I need you to know that.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, I know.

DIANE: And sometimes I think that I know myself,
but maybe that's a trap.
Because maybe I am Cool Sexy Diane,
or Really In Touch
With Her Feelings Diane.
Or possibly other Dianes
we don't even know about yet.
The point is, I'm all of the Dianes.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I know exactly what you're talking about.

DIANE: I love that you do crazy things
that make no sense,
like fill our house up
with spaghetti strainers.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I had a very good reason for that,
but I do not remember what it was.

DIANE: And we're really good for each other.
Or at least, you're good for me.
And you're fun. And you're sweet.
And I love you. And I need you.
And I don't always know
how to tell you that. But drugs help.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's right, honey. Drugs are great.

DIANE: And now, I'm going to carry my man to bed.
Here we go.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, okay.
Uh, is this a good idea?

DIANE: The drugs want me to do this,
and that means it's a good idea.
Drugs, I thought we were friends.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh.
Why were you working in the dark?
Pointless.
I don't have any leisure.
Thank you.

DIANE: What's gonna happen tomorrow?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't know.

DIANE: Are we going to fight?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No.

DIANE: We are. Drugs are gonna wear off
and I'm gonna be mean.
Why am I so mean?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You're not mean.

DIANE: Let's go to the Labrador Peninsula.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah?

DIANE: Spend New Year's with your family.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, you are gonna love it up there.
I have an uncle who still plays the flute
at the local pub every week.

DIANE: I want to hear him.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ohh, you can't.
He plays in dog frequency.

DIANE: Aww.
Why especially now?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, don't worry. Your baby's fine.

DIANE: What do you mean "baby"?
Why do you say "baby"?
Motherf--
