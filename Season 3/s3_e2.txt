BOJACK: Whoa.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So, that was weird.

BOJACK: Yeah. Wait.
Why did you think that was weird?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Just you know, you and me together, weird.

BOJACK: So it's not because
I did that talking penis thing, right?
Just the general concept of us
sleeping together that's weird, right?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah.
Oh, my God, 2007?
Is that what time it is?
I gotta get my Uggs on and get to work.

BOJACK: Well, you sure you don't want
to just hang around for a little bit?
I got no plans.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, sadly, I have to go to my job,
to help my boss find gigs
for you to turn down.

BOJACK: If Marv brought me something good,
I would do it.
Besides, I'm still decompressing
from my last gig.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Horsin' Around?
That ended 11 years ago.

BOJACK: Really? Where does the time go?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So what, you're just gonna stay at home
and get drunk all day?

BOJACK: Don't climb up my ass. I invited you
to play hooky and hang out with me.
I got a new HD DVD player.
Let's get wrecked and get Shreked.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Look BoJack, last night was fun
and you're sweet, sort of.
I don't want to make a thing of this.

BOJACK: Great so we agree. It's not a thing.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Not a thing.

BOJACK: Definitely not a thing.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, this is not a thing.

BOJACK: Yeah.

TODD: "Who do you like,
question mark, colon, bracket"?
I don't like anyone.
If I have to, I guess, uh... Kimber?
Who do you like?
The show, or that weird saxophone
that Kenny G plays?
Whoa! Hey, speaking of mobs,
we gotta bounce if we're gonna make
that flash mob at the Grove.
Man, I love flash mobs.
Whoo! Flash mobs.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Not overseas, underseas.
You're looking at the new face
of Seaborn's Seahorse Milk.
Beats me, but you better believe
I'm trusting Seaborn's.
For all my seahorse milk needs.
Hey, I'm not too big for anything.
And my flip phone
is blowing up with opportunities.
Michael Vick made me
a very strange offer.
But I'm gonna hear him out.
Always take the meeting.

DIANE: Ahem. Can I help you?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'll have an Americano
with steamed milk instead of water.

DIANE: One latte?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: For you, my second and final wife?
One lukewarm coffee
for my gorgeous spouse.

DIANE: Name?
Mmm... uh...
Oh, yeah.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Thank you, Blarn?

DIANE: That's my name.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Right out here, Marv, same place
I've been for the last 14 years.
We have three standouts here.
A feature called
No Country For Old Men.
It's about a hunter who--
Then you might not like this next one,
There Will Be Blood?
Oh!
This last one is really special.
It's a TV pilot from a veteran sitcom
writer named Cuddlywhiskers called...
Hmm... Mitch's Life.
I think if we attach the right talent,
this could be a hit.
You know who'd be great?
BoJack Horseman.
I think with the right project,
BoJack could--
No.
You know,
I would like to be an agent someday.
Mark my words.
Hmm...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, I brought you Four Loko.
I brought four Four Lokos.
That's 16 Lokos.

BOJACK: Finally someone brings me
an adequate amount of Lokos.
Are you trying to get me drunk?
You were trying to get me drunk.
Where are you taking me,
what am I wearing?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: To a meeting, and your clothes.

BOJACK: Is this a fedora?
What am I, Jason Mirzizzerzaz?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't know who you're talking about.

BOJACK: You know who I'm talking about.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I knew you wouldn't take this meeting
if I didn't trick you into it.
Cuddlywhiskers has a great script
and wants to meet you.

BOJACK: I have a script for you. It's called
"The BoJack Says No Chronicles".
Fade in, Princess Carolyn's car.
Princess Carolyn: "Hey, BoJack, you want
to do this dumbass thing?" Act break.
Act two.
BoJack turns to Princess Carolyn.
BoJack: "No, thank you." End of episode.
You see, this is why I don't
go out amongst the not-famouses.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Just do me a favor
and take this meeting.
If you're a good boy,
we can do that weird French thing
you saw in that Internet video.

BOJACK: Ooh, parkour?
Huh.
That show did so much
for the way society views krill people.
Did you try spending the money on things?
Whoa.
Uh...
You wanna to tell me about the show?
I hear it's great.
Yeah, I got it.
Huh.
I got it.

DIANE: Yes, Wayne.
Oh, my God, check it out,
a rejection letter from The New Yorker.
"Dear Diane.
We are sorry to say that your piece,
'An Open Letter to Open Letters',
wasn't right for us,
despite its evident merit."
Do you know what this means?
Someone gave my piece a read
and decided against it.
I never even thought they'd read it.
Then they typed me a letter
that said it had "obvious merit".
For two people
who don't like The New Yorker,
you know a lot about the different
sections of The New Yorker.

BOJACK: And then Cuddlywhiskers said:
"What if we stopped thinking of TV
as a conduit to tell stories
and thinking of it
as a conduit to tell truth?"
And I was like: "Damn, this guy
must have gone to Yale or something."

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Sounds like you two really hit it off.

BOJACK: We were like Heidi and Spencer
up in there.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So you're gonna do the show?

BOJACK: Nah. Timing's really off right now.
iPhone's coming out this year,
I need to gear up for that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm done. That's it, I'm tired
of bending over backwards for you.

BOJACK: I mean this in all seriousness,
professionally or in bed?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Why won't you do this?
Give me one good reason.

BOJACK: Because his show sounds incredible.
And what if... I'm not?
What if there's a reason the only thing
I'm known for is Horsin' Around?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, you are amazing.
You're bright and you're funny
and you're handsome and you're talented.
But if you can't see that,
then you're the biggest,
dumbest piece of shit in the world.

TODD: How long do we have to stay in here?
Uh...
That's not true. It's just that, Emily...
I've never kissed anyone before.
Okay, so how should we do it?
French style, Eskimo, Butterfly?
Okay.

BOJACK: Jeez, sleep much?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Jeez, watch me sleep much?

BOJACK: Well, I couldn't sleep.
I kept thinking about
today's first read-through.
These things
are always so nerve-wracking,
to sit there and perform
for all these people like some kind of a--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Professional actor?

BOJACK: Very funny.
Before I forget, I got you a present.
It's a box...
with crinkly tissue paper inside it.
How did you know?

BOJACK: Thank you
for putting this whole thing together.
Even though I still can't believe
I let you talk me into this.
Promise me
everything's going to be okay?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I promise it's gonna be great.
If you get scared,
look for me in the audience.
I'll be there the whole time,
laughing and cheering louder than anyone.

BOJACK: "Goodbye, old friend."
Thank you.
That's the worst part of America.
Other than the bottom,
the top and most of the sides.
Huh.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow.
It seems like you're really
in sync with this Justin guy.
You should do all the things
with him that I can't do.
Like eat chocolate,
or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.
Why, tennis makes me so mad.
Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball?

DIANE: Mom, I'm finally gonna be
a published writer.
My "Open Letter to Open Letters"
is going to be published in McSweeney's.
No, Mom. It's a very popular website.
Mom.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And my Blockbuster original series
has been keeping me very busy.
Babe, it makes total sense.
They make the whole season,
put it on six DVD's.
People go to their local Blockbuster Video
and rent it out one disc at a time
for five days each.
They can just get something else,
like The Illusionist or The Prestige.
Whichever one you were in.
Do you?
I get excited by the possibilities.
Look, a CD, at a coffee shop?
That is crazy.
Buying it.

BOJACK: You heard what the network said.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.

BOJACK: Exactly. The network loved it.
Obviously, we're playing it too safe.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: If you want my opinion, fellas,
you hit oil, stop drilling.
"I am an oil man.
I drink your milkshake."
That'll be funny in a year or so.

BOJACK: Before that got sad and weird,
you said, "If you want my opinion,"
and we don't.
Cuddlywhiskers, you told me
you wanted to do something different.
Now we're doing something that's gonna be
"just as good as Horsin' Around."
Is that what you wanted?
Because that's not why I'm here.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I really think you're making a mistake.
I'm not about to take career advice
from somebody who's been
an assistant the last 14 years.
Is that how you think of me?
As your agent's assistant?

BOJACK: What do you think you are?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't know.

BOJACK: Here's some free advice:
you should know.
Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups?
Somebody needs coffee,
I'll give you a ring.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, best of luck.

BOJACK: Cuddlywhiskers,
let's give ourselves one night
to stick our dicks in this script
and go balls deep into the universe.
I want to be an agent. I think I'm ready.
It's just called "agent", Marv, agent.
What?
Oh, my God, I'm an agent!
I'm gonna make it after all.
First thing I'm gonna do
is get rid of that ceiling fan.

BOJACK: How do we make it clear
that this isn't Horsin' Around?
What if in the very first scene,
we show my character
literally taking a massive dump
on a VHS copy of Horsin' Around?
I want this character to be really edgy,
the kind of character Denis Leary
would be offered and then say:
"This character's too edgy for me."
Like if every time he entered the room
he was like, "Whassup, bitches?"
But not that, because that's horrible.
But something like that.
That is so dumb.
Yes, put that in.
Put all this in, this should be the show.
Yes. This is brilliant.
Oh, my God, yes.
Just him turning the page.
A close-up of my eyeball.
The real shit, they never show that.
Wow, we did it.
We stayed up all night, but we really made
something new and different and daring.
We've changed everything but the title.
Oh, Cuddlywhiskers,
I don't know what to say.
Something like that.
We'll figure it out.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Seriously, can I hear 400 dollars?
Let's not forget why we're here tonight.
To raise money
for the John Edwards campaign.
You know I was talking
to one of the volunteers earlier
and she was just gushing
about how John Edwards touched her.
I say, let's make this man president
so he can touch whoever he wants.
Four hundred dollars.
Erica, you know you're not
allowed to vote in national elections.

TODD: You sure it's okay
to be in your parents' bedroom?
Uh...
No. I'm ready for sexual situations.
Hooray. Um, taking your virginity.
Okay, here we-- Here I go.
Uh, this is Todd doing sex.
Your dad, the mobster?
You said he was like that guy
from The Sopranos.
Oh, God, oh, God! Even worse.
He must be so desensitized to violence
and nihilistic ruminations
on the banality of evil.
You know I love shimmying,
but that's a two-story drop.
Uh, okay.
Oh, shit.
Sorry.
Whoa, whoa, Tony marries Dr. Melfi?
Mamma mia!

BOJACK: So, the island's purgatory, right?
Hold that thought.
Hey, Princess Carolyn, you came.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I figured since I'm your agent, I should
at least show up to your premiere party.

BOJACK: Look I know I haven't called in a while.
I've been really busy.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I figured you'd call me
if you needed a coffee.

BOJACK: Ouch.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, big premiere tonight.
Very exciting.

BOJACK: Yeah.
After tonight, it's no more "Aren't you
the horse from Horsin' Around?"
From now on it'll be,
"You're BoJack Horseman."

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm happy for you, BoJack.

BOJACK: So how about a kiss for good luck?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, BoJack.
I'm your agent and your friend,
and I will always support you.
But I'm 33 years old, and I want
to have a family by the time I'm 40.
I don't want to spend the next seven years
in and out of love with you.
I've wasted too much time
waiting for things to happen.
And I'm not gonna wait anymore.
And for what it's worth, I always liked
the horse from Horsin' Around.

BOJACK: You did?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah. Everybody did.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Can we not fight while I'm at a gig?
There are a lot of big producers,
this could be my next big break.
I now pronounce me very impressed,
but I'm not getting those kinds of offers.
Hey, if you like Justin so much,
maybe you should just continue
to be really good friends with him.
Uh, I didn't say that.

DIANE: You wanted water?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Thanks.
Wait. Blarn, right?
Yeah, from the coffee shop.
What are you doing here?
Is there coffee to "bariste"?

DIANE: I also do cater waiter gigs
to make ends meet.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You "bariste" and cater and waiter?
Triple threat.
I should be bringing you the water.

DIANE: You know, just for the record, I think
it's cool that you put yourself out there.
A lot of guys in your position
wouldn't take gigs like this.
They'd be afraid people
would make fun of them.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's dumb.
If you care about what other people think,
you're never gonna do anything.

DIANE: Yeah, you're right.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, my God, I'm so glad you agree.
For a second I was like, "Why did I say that?
That was so dumb."
Then you were like, "That's right."
And I was like, "Ooh! Validation."
Hey, mind if I change out of this shirt?

DIANE: Go ahead.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: This monkey suit is killing me.

DIANE: Oof! Hey there, Delilah.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Sweet hang, Blarn.
You're one in a million.

DIANE: Actually, my name isn't Blarn.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What?

DIANE: I put that on my nametag as a dumb joke
to subvert the idea
of co-opting personal identity
to further corporate branding which,
as I'm saying it, isn't much of a joke.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: "Blarn." That is very funny.
You should be a writer.

DIANE: Thanks. I'm Diane.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Mr. Peanutbutter.

DIANE: Yeah, I know.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Add me on MySpace, okay?

DIANE: Sure.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right.
Guess I'll see you around, Diana.

DIANE: It's Diane.

BOJACK: Hey, buddy, slight change of plans.
Call it off.
Call the whole thing off.
Call the network,
cancel the whole thing.
Nobody wants to see me take a dump
on a Horsin' Around VHS.
Easy for you to say.
It's my name on the show.
This is why I didn't want to do
another TV show. Everything was perfect.
Yes, I am.
Whassup, bitches?
