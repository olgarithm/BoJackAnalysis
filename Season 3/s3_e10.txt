MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hello! Here I am, Mr. Peanutbutter.
That's my name and I am here.
Okay, the nominees. Nominees for Oscar.
Who are the nominees?
Well, as I used to say on
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:
What Do They Know? Do They
Know Things? Let's Find Out,
let's find out.
For Best Actor, the nominees are.
Jurj Clooners for The
Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.
Bread Poot for City of AIDS.
Colin Firth for First Things Firth.
The Colin Firth Story.
Michael Fassbender for...
I want to say Bill Gates?
And BoJack Horseman for Secretariat.

BOJACK: Whoa.
I feel...
I-I feel...
I feel...
the same.
It happened again. Why do I keep
thinking things will make me happy?
What is wrong with me?
Uh... Oh, God, I'm drowning.
I feel like I'm drowning.
That is a terrifying story.
I don't deserve
this. I'm not a best actor.
That's literally the
only thing they're about.
I was right. I am one
of the special people.
What are we doing just sitting here?
I just got nominated for an Oscar.
We gotta party like it's 1982,
the year Prince released 1999.

BOJACK: No.
Tell them I want my free Tesla parked
in my goddamn living room. I'm BoJack!
Yeah, now we're doing
it! Look at us partying.

DIANE: Hi.

BOJACK: You get a load of this
chili cheese fountain?
Grab a handful of beans and go to town.

DIANE: Hey, this is all really something.
But I actually just came because
I heard about the nomination
and I wanted to make sure you're okay.

BOJACK: That's a funny way of
saying congratulations.
But not funny "ha-ha", more
like funny Doonesbury.

DIANE: I know how this kind of thing can
sometimes send you spinning.
"Oh, God, why doesn't this make me
happy? Will anything make me happy?
I'm an empty husk." That kind of thing.

BOJACK: Well, thank you for that, but
I'm actually doing great.
I direct your attention to the
aforementioned chili cheese fountain!

DIANE: It's too bad I'm not
managing your social campaign anymore,
because this party would
make a great Snapchat story.

BOJACK: You are not gonna make me
guilty about leaving Princess Carolyn.

DIANE: I'm not here to make you
feel guilty. Like I said...

BOJACK: Honestly, I don't even know
what you're doing over there.
Tweeting for celebrities?

DIANE: Well, actually, I don't...

BOJACK: When I met you, you
were so cool and interesting...

DIANE: Uh, I was never cool.

BOJACK: You used to actually care
about shit. What happened?

DIANE: I don't know, BoJack. Maybe
caring about shit got old.
Maybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at
me and sending death
threats to my house,
and all my friends thinking I'm annoying,
and getting in fights with my husband,
and seeing little refugee
boys die in hospital bombings.
It's exhausting and I can't do
it. If that makes me a bad person,
then I'm sorry that I'm not
the "cool, interesting girl."

BOJACK: I never said you were a bad
person. I just said it's not you.
And you know it's not you.

DIANE: Oh, and this party is
you? Who are all these people?

BOJACK: These are my friends.

DIANE: Name one of them.

BOJACK: Tes-ley.

DIANE: You're just looking at the Tesla.

BOJACK: I don't know why it's so hard for
you to believe that I could be happy.
I'm not like you, okay?
I don't fetishize my own sadness.

DIANE: I don't fetishize my own sadness.

BOJACK: Sure.

DIANE: You don't know anything about me.

BOJACK: Hey!
I know that you can tweet for a living
in a house in Beverly
Hills that your husband bought,
or you can think you're better than
everyone, but you can't do both.

DIANE: I don't think I'm
better than everyone.

BOJACK: And again, I say, sure.

DIANE: You know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna win that Oscar, and
you're gonna go up on that stage
and give your little speech,
and then you're gonna go home.
And you're gonna be so
miserable, you'll want to kill yourself.
And you're gonna have
nobody left to stop you.

BOJACK: No one's gonna be
there when I kill myself?
Listen to that chanting, Diane.
The chanting don't lie.
There's going to be plenty of
people around when I kill myself.
Hey, Ana, can I ask you something?
So, if I win the Oscar...
Right. But after that, what's
gonna happen to us?
What we have.
What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Come on, buddy! Come on!

BOJACK: Mr. Peanutbutter!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Thank God you're okay.

BOJACK: Better than okay. I'm wonderful.
Thanks to you, you wonderful man.
When you said my name this
morning, you changed my life.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: About that...

BOJACK: Hey, did you see Erica here?
She was looking for you
earlier, with her good eye.
Her other eye was looking to the stars.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack, I need to talk to you.

BOJACK: Yeah? What's going on, buddy?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, I've got good
news and I've got bad news.
Raven on a wire. A gloomy
portent, precariously perched.
And, as the sun sets, so does
it spread its deathly shadow
across the just and unjust
of the outdoor seating area
of the California Pizza Kitchen.

TODD: Yeah. Wow! They really make regular
windows look like shit.
I can't look out the
window while lying on the floor?
No, thank you, regular window!
Well, it started as a
safe space for women.
Then, it became a safe
space for women and men.
Now, it's more of a
safe-ish space for women...
And a really safe space
for men to look at women...
While also being driven around by them.
Demand is skyrocketing.
That's why we need a
bigger office space.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You come to work, clock in,
you put sugar in your coffee,
and watch it slowly
disappear into nothingness.
But the sugar doesn't know
why. Sugar didn't ask to be born.

TODD: He recently found out that
his brother's sick.
Ooh!
Did you hear that, Mr. Peanutbutter?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You know, I wish cats
really did have nine lives.
It would make me feel better about
how much I'm screwing up this one.
Sometimes I feel like, if I
could start everything over,
knowing what I know now, I'd
do it all right this time.
But other times I think...
No, I wouldn't.
As you all know, things have been rough,
and, unfortunately, we have
to scale back our staff.
Mainly, you.

DIANE: Are you firing me?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: In a sense, yes.
But, in another sense, I'm promoting you
to a position of finding
a job somewhere else.

DIANE: Yeah. I don't think I
ever thanked you for
giving me this job in the first place.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It was an honor to work with you.
You were the worst social media coordinator
this company ever had.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Are you sure you need surgery?
Can't you get a second opinion?
Nothing could make me
feel better right now.
Not even an amazing career
opportunity. Hold on, I'm
getting another call.
I've got to take this. It could be an
amazing career opportunity. Hello?
This isn't a great time,
Shep. Could you call back?
Ooh, a job like that? You want a
fully present presenter to present.
And I don't know if I've
got the pep in my step
to take that show where
it needs to go, you know?
I've got a real pepless step, Shep.
Hey, sorry about that. Just
got a call from the Oscars.
They want me to host...
Nomination announcement.
But I don't think I
have it in me right now.
Really?
Boy, that old gal had
something for everything, didn't she?
Okay, but you'll call me when
you get out of the surgery, right?
I'm not gonna let my
phone leave my sight.
Nomination.

TODD: It's here! The golden envelope.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hmm...
Okay. Oh, my phone. What
should I do with it, Todd?
Maybe you should hold it.

TODD: Uh-huh.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, I'll take it with me.

TODD: All right.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, you hold it.

TODD: Sure thing, yeah.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, put it in my jacket pocket.

TODD: Right here. Okay.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, no, it's a fake
pocket. Tricked again!
Todd, it's ringing. This is it.
Oh, no, my phone!
Oh, no, I kicked it, right through
that doorway into the hallway!
Now, other people are kicking it
and it's sliding across the floor!
Okay, this is getting absurd.

TODD: Let's get that phone!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Excuse me!

TODD: Hey!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: There it goes. Sorry. If you could just... My phone!

TODD: I'm coming to get you!
That way!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Come on, phone. Just stop!
Hello?
Oh, no.
Oh, my God, that's incredible!
Nominations. You got it, buddy.
Okay. Now, where's the... the...
Uh-oh. Could've sworn
it was right here.

TODD: Oh!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yes, just as soon as you give me that
backup envelope, please and por favor.
That was a test and you passed.
Yes, gotta get out there, on to the
stage, to announce the nominations.
Just as soon as I... Oh, my
God, is that Bradley Cooper?
Let's go, Todd.

TODD: Oh, God, what do we do?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's okay.
We just need to come up with
all the nominees ourselves.

TODD: But I haven't even seen all the movies.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd, nobody has. That's
not how they give out awards.

TODD: But...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Time for talk is over.
Now's the time for action.
And by "action," I mean talking
about these 24 categories
until we've settled
on a list of nominees.
You need to tell me right
now, are you in or out?

TODD: Well, when you put it that way,
I guess you can call
me high-waisted denim,
because, right now, I am very in.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Let's do this.
What did you think of Frieda Pinto?

TODD: Are you kidding me? Anybody
could do what she did.
"Don't take my baby. I'll
give you all my Bitcoins!"

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow. That is good.

TODD: Okay, for Best Picture,
what about Avatar?
That was a good movie.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: True, but did that come out this year?

TODD: I feel like I just saw it.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, there's no way to know for sure.
Let's just throw it on the list.

TODD: Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewis down
for anything? He's always there.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Good catch! I'll add him.
Daniel Day-Lewis.
Okay. We need one more nominee for
Best Actor. Oh, what about BoJack?
His performance in Secretariat
was as thoughtful and self-aware
as we've ever seen him.
Besides, he's our friend.

TODD: Is he?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Whoa! I am surprised to
hear you say that, Todd Chavez.
Let's dig into that. We have time.

TODD: I don't think we do.
You're supposed to be announcing
these, like, now.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: There is always time to
talk about our feelings.
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say,
"There's always time to
talk about feelings,
because feelings are the
ceilings of our hearts,
and a leaky feeling
ceiling leads to a flood of blood.
And I'm cold. Will you
pass me that blanket?"

TODD: Well, I guess I'm just tired of
BoJack walking all over everybody
and still getting everything he wants.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I think the
important thing to remember here
is that BoJack is a damaged individual,
struggling against a sea of demons, many
self-created, but still all too real.
Getting this nomination from the
two friends he loves the most...
you and also me... would
really mean a lot to him.

TODD: Okay.
But did you really think he
was that good in the movie?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.
And the final nominee for
Best Picture is Avatar.
Well, those are all the nominations.
I will not be taking any questions.
Goodbye. I must go.
I gotta say, we
picked some top-notch noms.

TODD: You know it!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Boy, was I glad when we got
out of that theater, though.

TODD: I know. So many questions.
"Oh, what the hell happened?
Why were you reading off that
napkin? Why are you guys running?"

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: They have their nominees.
What more could they want?

TODD: You know what's crazy?
We saved the day today,
and no one will ever even know.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, we'll know.
Oh, boy.
So, the good news is, my
brother's surgery was a success.
And the bad news is, you're
not nominated for an Oscar.
And the other good news is...
that
each breath is a gift
and it is a joy to live.

BOJACK: What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We are so lucky we get to be alive.

BOJACK: No, before that.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, I didn't tell you.
My brother's been sick.

BOJACK: No, I don't care about your brother.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: First of all, manners.
Second of all, I think if you met
him, you'd actually really hit it off.
Imagine me but with less "in
your face" cool guy attitude.

BOJACK: Did you say I'm not
nominated for an Oscar?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: A lot of people are mighty steamed,
but I feel like what
everyone's overlooking here is,
I got most of the categories dead-on.
That's pretty amazing, and I am
not getting enough credit for that.
Did you know that
Avatar came out in 2009?

BOJACK: I'm not nominated for an Oscar.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No.
But you know what they say. "It's
an honor just to be nominated."
Oh, wait.

BOJACK: So, I'm just like everybody else.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I know you're upset, but whatever
you do, please don't get mad at Todd.

BOJACK: Why would I get mad at Todd?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Exactly. This is totally my fault.
He didn't even want to nominate you.

BOJACK: What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: With the gift of hindsight,
I see now how that might
have made you even more upset.
But I realized something today, when
my brother called from the hospital,
and I think it's gonna make
you feel a lot better.

BOJACK: What? What is it?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: None of this matters.
Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What are we doing? What was
the point of any of this?
I wasted everyone's time for six months.
Soon, I'll get some offer from
one of the big five agencies
that I can't say no to,
and I'll go back to being another cog
in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti
maker that is this industry.
Is that the best I can hope for?
What is it, Judah?
Yeah, maybe.
It's been a pleasure working
with you, Judah.

DIANE: And then, he said, I
fetishize my own sadness.
I don't know.
Did you ask for water?
They're not supposed to
give us water unless we ask.
Don't they know there's a drought?
No, I want the water. I just...
I went to BoJack's
house to congratulate him.
I'm not trying to pick fights.
Is he right? Am I a bad person?
I do not have a fixation,
Roxy. I worry about him.
They're filling everyone's
glasses. This is insane.
Hey, excuse me? Excuse me?
Do you know you're breaking the
law by giving everybody water?
Yeah, we all want
water. That's not the point.
In the state of California, it
is illegal for a restaurant
to serve people water
before they ask for it.
There is a drought.
You know, this is
what's wrong with society.
Nobody thinks about the
world outside themselves.
So, how you doing? You
still working at that place?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hi, Ralph. It's Princess Carolyn.
I might have some free time coming up.
I was wondering if you
might want to get a drink.
Okay?
Oh.
What?
Oh.
What?
Really?
It's a date.

BOJACK: Ana?
I don't care. Take it.
Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.
Please call me back. I need you.
Ana, please. This is
BoJack, by the way. Horseman.
Hey! Todd! Where you been?

TODD: Oh, hi.

BOJACK: You were in Ojai?

TODD: No, I was just saying hi.

BOJACK: Well, why not go to Ojai, huh?
You and me? I could use
an escape, couldn't you?

TODD: It's not really a good time.

BOJACK: Todd, I need this. You're my
best friend and I need you.
Don't leave me now. Don't
be like everybody else.

TODD: I'm not leaving you. I just...
Besides, I think you owe me,
right? After what you did?

TODD: What I did?

BOJACK: Come on, Todd. I know.
Mr. Peanutbutter told me everything.

TODD: Everything?
Even told you, when I was a kid, I
used to bang on my
butt like a bongo drum
when I got out of the bath?

BOJACK: What?
Mm, no, not-not about that.

TODD: So, he didn't tell you everything.
Did he tell you about the
time I counted to a million?
One, two, three, four, five, six...

BOJACK: No, stop.

TODD: But I was just getting to the good part!

BOJACK: What? Seven? He told me you didn't
want to nominate me for an Oscar.

TODD: Oh, that.

BOJACK: What the hell, man?
After everything I've done for you?

TODD: What are you talking about?

BOJACK: Oh, I don't know. Letting you
live here for free for six years?
Giving you food, indulging you in
your little projects and adventures
and stories about how you used to
bang on your butt like a bongo drum?
I let you turn my house
into your company's
headquarters for the last month.

TODD: Yeah, but that's not because
you're my friend.
That's because you felt bad about Emily.

BOJACK: You know about Emily?

TODD: I think I know. Why?
What do you think I know?
I mean, I know what I think,
but I don't know if the thing that I
think is the thing
that you think I know.
You know?

BOJACK: So, you know I had sex with Emily.

TODD: You had sex with Emily?!

BOJACK: Well, what did you think?

TODD: I don't know! Not that!
I just knew something sketchy happened.
I thought maybe you gave
her one of your weird monologues
about how sad you are,
and it bummed her out!

BOJACK: Todd, I'm sorry, all
right? I screwed up.
I know I screwed up.
I don't know why...

TODD: Oh, great! Of course!
Here it comes!
You can't keep doing this!
You can't keep doing shitty
things, and then feel
bad about yourself
like that makes it okay!
You need to be better!

BOJACK: I know. And I'm sorry, okay?
I was drunk, and there was all this
pressure with the Oscar campaign.
But now... Now that it's over, I...

TODD: No! No, BoJack, just stop.
You are all the things
that are wrong with you.
It's not the alcohol, or the drugs,
or any of the shitty things that
happened to you in your career,
or when you were a kid.
It's you.
All right? It's you.
Fuck, man. What else is there to say?
