BOJACK: Can you just tell her BoJack's here?
Horseman. I'm an old friend.
It was incredible.
When you sang that one ballad
and shot fireworks out of your boobs,
that was such a moving tribute
to gays in the military.
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
You mean Calvin Klein.
Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.
Uh...
Who's Sarah Lipschitz?
Oof!
Right.
Uh, what?
Well, actually, I'm doing this new show,
The BoJack Horseman Show.
I don't know if you've seen it or--
Yeah, no, of course, no,
but it's been a lot of fun.
The ratings aren't great,
but we have this upcoming episode,
and we're looking
for a really big guest star.
Well, I just thought it would
be really fun for... the both of us.
You know, like the old days.
I have the script with me
if you want to take a look at it.
Over here?
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: A movie, during the day? Dare I?
One for Secretariat, please!
Thank you.
And, now, to turn my phone off.
If anyone needs me in the next two hours,
they'll just have to wait.

TODD: What's going on?
Oh, no!
Come on, come on, come on!
Pick up, Mr. Peanutbutter!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hello?

TODD: Oh! Mr. Peanutbutter, we need--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You've reached the voicemail
of Mr. Peanutbutter.

TODD: No!

BOJACK: I'm not just running for me.
I'm running for America.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh-ho-ho!

TODD: Cabracadabblers,
to Mr. Peanutbutter's house!
The house. Obviously, the house.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow, that was a good movie.
Was it Oscar-worthy? Who's to say?
Ninety-eight messages?
Better listen to them all, in order.

TODD: Mr. Peanutbutter, call me back
as soon as you get this, okay?
We need your strainers.
This is life and death.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, my God!

TODD: Mr. Peanutbutter,
I'm at your house with the entire
Cabracadabra fleet, but we can't get in!
You need to get over here!
It's a spaghetti-strainer-related
emergency.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right, buddy, just as soon as I listen
to these other 96 messages.
Oh, I don't have time for this!
Spaghetti or not, here I come.

BOJACK: Sabrina, I'm coming down
for my birthday surprise!
Well, I've heard of
pasta point of no return,
but this is ridiculous!
Why didn't you just tell me
you made too much spaghetti?
Sabrina, that's not going to happen.
We're a family now, no matter what,
and I will always be there for you.
Now, get in that kitchen
and eat all that spaghetti.

DIANE: I never understood why
the Horsin' Around house
had two sets of stairs.

BOJACK: What?

DIANE: One in the living room
and one in the kitchen. Why?
Have you ever been in a house like that?

BOJACK: What are you doing here?

DIANE: You didn't answer your phone.
I was worried about you.

BOJACK: The funeral was huge.
There were so many people there.
I kept thinking, "I did this to her,"
and everyone was just standing around
like, "Well, this was bound to happen,"
but... it wasn't bound to happen.

DIANE: I'm really sorry, BoJack.

BOJACK: I don't know how to be, Diane.
It doesn't get better
and it doesn't get easier.
I can't keep lying to myself,
saying "I'm gonna change." I'm poison.

DIANE: BoJack--

BOJACK: I come from poison.
I have poison inside me,
and I destroy everything I touch.
That's my legacy.
I have nothing to show
for the life that I've lived,
and I have nobody in my life
who's better off for having known me.

DIANE: That isn't true.

BOJACK: Isn't it, though?

DIANE: When I was a kid,
I used to watch you on TV.
And you know I didn't have
the best family.
Things weren't that great for me.
But, for half an hour every week,
I got to watch this show
about four people who had nobody,
who came together and became a family.
And, for half an hour every week,
I had a home,
and it helped me survive.
BoJack, there are millions of people
who are better off for having known you.

BOJACK: Why did you never tell me that?

DIANE: I guess to preserve some fiction
of journalistic objectivity.
Like that's a thing.

BOJACK: I know you don't want to hear this,
but you're too good to be writing
Instagram captions for celebrities.

DIANE: I'm not just--

BOJACK: I'm sorry, but you are.
You know you are.

DIANE: Okay. Thank you.

BOJACK: And I wish you didn't get so distant
after you moved out.

DIANE: I'm sorry.

BOJACK: You know me better than anybody,
and you can't not be a part of my life.
I want to do Ethan Around.
No, it's me, BoJack Horseman.
Yeah. I think now more than ever
people need shows like Horsin' Around.
I... need a show like Horsin' Around.
What? No.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Please, please! I'm no hero.
I'm just a guy
with some bowls full of holes.
Thanks again.
It's funny. You help out
at one disaster area,
and, suddenly, everybody loves you,
unless you're Sean Penn.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press,
and you can buy most kinds of press.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I hope some of that press
makes its way to this reader
because she is not a fan
of Cabracadabra.
She hates it.

DIANE: I don't hate Cabracadabra.
I just think it objectifies women
and contributes to a cheap and damaging
culture of sexist commodification
that undercuts the exact reason
it was started in the first place.
But, you know, everything does that.
Cosmo does that.
Kids' movies, athletic gear... statues.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yes, but this objectification of women
ended up saving lots of lives,
many of whom were also women,
so, therefore, not sexist?

DIANE: I can't argue with that.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, the good news is,
you don't have to anymore,
because I'm selling the company!
You know, it's really too bad
you shut down the agency,
because, if you could've held out
for just a couple more months,
right now,
Vim would be rolling in money.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm really happy for you,
but I'm actually enjoying my time off.
Ralph and I went on vacation.
Those Egyptians really know
how to treat a cat.

DIANE: And what do you do, Ralph,
that you can just hop on a plane to Cairo?
Oh, because you're a mouse?
Oh, my God! Like Stilton hotels?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I gotta take this. It's my new agent.
Hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So, anyway--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Another offer? That's incredible!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ralph and I--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: They want to pay me how much?
That is a lot of zeroes. Sign me up.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What is he doing?
You never take the first offer.

DIANE: Well, I'm just weighing my options.
I don't want to just jump into my next--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You know what you should do?
Ralph's sister Stefani
is starting a new website.
It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity blog/
newsletter/community hub,
and she's looking for a partner/editor/
"bomb-ass super bitch," her words.
You'd be perfect for it.
I'll set a meeting.

DIANE: Yeah, that could be cool.
Why don't you give her my info?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, no. I'll just set a meeting.
It's easy. I'm not doing anything else.
Right.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow, another amazing offer!
It's like everywhere I look,
money, money, money!
Even ten percent of this
would be quite a windfall.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah.
I like it, too.
I wasn't a manager. I was an agent.
Oh, my God!
Maybe that was the problem!
All this time, I thought I was an agent,
but what if what I was really
supposed to be was a manager?
It's a completely different line of work.
An agent helps a client find jobs,
but a manager helps manage
a client's career.
I think I'm having an epiphany.
It's like I've been wearing
the wrong bra size this whole time.
No, Ralph. Don't you get it?
This is a new beginning.
I'm gonna be a manager!

BOJACK: Wow.
Listen, before everyone
gets here tomorrow,
I have a couple notes on the script.
No. On page 18,
Ethan and the Horse try to get Julia
to put on the roller skates,
and she runs out of the room crying,
and then, the Horse says,
"That went well."
Anything about that feel weird to you?
No, I get the irony.
That's not the issue.
This is a guaranteed laugh.
You're giving me the cut to commercial.
You can't give all the best jokes to me.
You tell me. Let's hear it.
You're pushing too hard.
The line's funny. Trust the line.
Great. Now let me hear you throw it away.
Yes, that was great!
And that was a great look,
with the eyebrow.
What if we both did that?
Exactly. Let's try it.
Yeah, you feel that?
Now that's how you cut to commercial.

DIANE: This place has really gone downhill
since they got that new chef.
Sorry, did you say "croosh"?
So, can I ask what
the business model is here?
Well, you know what's great about that is,
if you're not beholden to ad revenue,
your writers can--
Thank you.
Why would I have to do that?
He's actually selling that company.
If I have a problem with my husband,
I'm gonna talk to him about it directly.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You got the job?

DIANE: I got the job!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, my God! Can you believe it?
In the same week,
I sell a company for millions of dollars
and you get a job writing for a blog.
When it rains, it pours, huh?

TODD: And over here is where you can keep
all of your receipts,
in your leaning tower of receipts.
Okay.
Whoa!
This is for eight million dollars.
Todd, as a millionaire?
That'll lead to some interesting stories.
What an exciting development.
How's that gonna change the dynamic?
I guess we're gonna find out, right?
Hooray! Todd's in the one percent.
Oh, uh...
Hey.

BOJACK: Julia, this ice cream is only for girls
who try on their roller skates.
So, what do you say?
What? I'll be in my trailer.
Hey, Chloe, that was really funny.
Are you having fun?
You got any friends in the audience?
Oh. You want to know a secret
about your mommy and daddy?
They are really proud of you.
What do you want to be
when you grow up, Chloe?
Like me?
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
I can't be here.
I can't do this again. This isn't right.
I need to go.
I'm sorry. I just-- I don't belong here.
I don't know.

TODD: So, what are you gonna do
with your eight million dollars?
I've always wanted to go
to a super nice restaurant
and order everything on the menu.
We should go sometime, together.
Of course.
Whoa. Why would you even--?
I'm not gay.
I mean, I don't think I am,
but... I don't think I'm straight, either.
I don't know what I am.
I think I might be nothing.
Yeah?
Oh, crap! I accidentally tipped
the waitress eight million dollars!
Well, guess I'm broke again.

DIANE: Who could that be?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Pizza?
Katrina, you're not pizza.
Oh, is it being married to you again?
Because I'd rather get euthanized.
Spoiler alert from Marley & Me.
If you've got a gig for me,
you can go through my new manager.
Then what are you talking about?
Oh, my God, this is so classic Katrina!
Whoa.
Of California?

DIANE: Who's at the door? Is it pizza?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Thank you, Judah.
Tell her I don't work for BoJack.
