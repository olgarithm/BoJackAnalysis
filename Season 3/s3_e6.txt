DIANE: ...fucker!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So, we have some options.

DIANE: Yeah, a lot of options to discuss.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You know I love you.

DIANE: That's not what this is about.
We always agreed
we didn't want kids, unless--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: A streetwise but soulful teen
needed somewhere to live
as he waited
for his Juilliard audition.

DIANE: And we'd support his dancing and let him
stay in the guest room, right.
But a baby? Are you--?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's not about me.
There's no "I" in uterus,
there's only "us."
And "U," and another "U,"
but that's the "U" that's in "us,"
so I already said that "U."
The point is,
I'm going to be here for you, 24/7.
Two hundred and forty-seven percent,
that's how "there for you" I'll be.
Whatever you decide...

DIANE: What we decide, because this is--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Definitely. This is a conversation.

DIANE: Let's both say what we want
at the same time on three.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay.

DIANE: One, two--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: On three or after three?

DIANE: How could I say it "on three"?
I'll be saying "three."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay. Okay.

DIANE: One, two, three...
Abortion.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Get an abortion.
Oh, no. We said different things.

BOJACK: Oh, my God.
Nine out of ten?
If you were an airline
and landed nine out of ten planes,
you wouldn't exactly brag about that
in your commercial.
Hey, Diane.
Diane, Diane, Diane.

DIANE: I'm doing my job, BoJack.

BOJACK: Young people and their phones.
There could be a beautiful rainbow
in this room right now
and you would have no idea.
Really makes you think, huh?
Can you look at rainbows on your phone?

DIANE: Shut up, BoJack.
Shit.
I just tweeted "Shut up, BoJack,"
as Cynthia Nixon.

BOJACK: I'd buy it. She is not a fan,
and for good reason.
We were up in the Poconos, she and I...

DIANE: BoJack, not now.

BOJACK: What's up your butt tonight?

DIANE: You really wanna know?

BOJACK: I would seriously like to know
what crawled up your butt,
made a home for itself in your butt,
started a family, lived a fruitful life,
and then died up your butt.

DIANE: I'm getting an abortion.

BOJACK: Whoa, that takes me back.
I had more than my share of abortions
in the '90s.
I didn't get them, I paid for them.
I really hope all those women
actually got the abortions,
and didn't just keep my money.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane, are you tweeting for pop starlet
Sextina Aquafina right now?

DIANE: I'm trying to. Why?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Because her account
just tweeted out to 40 million followers,
"I'm getting an abortion."

DIANE: What? No--
She--
Oh, balls.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane, VIM is hanging on by a thread
and only barely scraping by
because of clients like Sextina.
Hey! Heard you pulled the trigger
on the Big Bear condo.
Great investment.
We are not on the edge of complete ruin.
We are on the edge of complete ruin.

DIANE: I think if I explain it to her
and apologize, she'll understand.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Because she's so understanding?
This is a teenage pop star.
Literally the two least
compassionate entities
combined into the supernova
of not understanding
that is Sextina Aquafina.

DIANE: I think that's me.
I'll put out a statement
explaining the whole mess. I am so sorry.
Oh. Oh!
Taylor Swift just tweeted
that you were "brave."
Nicki Minaj tweeted at you
a face with heart eyes.
And BuzzFeed just posted a list
of top 15 celebrities
who should have had abortions
like Sextina.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Jeez you're trending like crazy.

DIANE: Most women who go through this
never talk about it
because it's so stigmatized.
The fact that you're coming out like this
is huge.
Or it would be, if you were
actually getting an abortion.
Well, no, because you're not.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, but if you did,
this would make you a cultural icon.

DIANE: Well...
Yeah...
Um...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane, take the yes.

DIANE: Okay.
Sextina Aquafina, you are now the face
of the pro-choice movement.
Now let's get you informed.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Why does she have to listen
to the heartbeat?

DIANE: That can't be true.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Don't worry, Diane, I will watch
the cute puppy videos for you.
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
Don't worry, Diane, we will watch
the cute puppy videos together.
Diane, I have some terrible news.

TODD: You need another drink?

BOJACK: Why? Because I lost, I'm a loser,
so I have to drown my sorrows in scotch?
I could use a scotch.

TODD: No I just meant because of thirst.
Oh, look. Jurj Clooners.

BOJACK: Jurj sucks.
What does everyone love about him?
He's not a god.
He's just an old guy who loves pranks.

TODD: Sure sounds like God.

BOJACK: Jurj, hey, man.

TODD: Hey, Jurj, my name's Todd,
and my friend Keith sleeps on your couch.

TODD: Oh.
That is so Keith.

BOJACK: Hey Todd, why don't you do the grown-ups
a favor and go find your own shadow?

TODD: It was here a second ago.

BOJACK: Jurj, I loved you
in The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.
How do you get in the head
of a war criminal?
Totally. I think I'm getting
the hang of all this now.
You won last night, the other guy
won tonight, maybe I'll win next time.
Huh.
Well--
Oh!

DIANE: New single?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Just relax.
Crack an egg on your head,
feel the yolk drip down.

DIANE: Oh, dear.
No, stop.
Christ, stop the tape.
I think the tone might be a little severe?
Ugh! I am getting an abortion.
You're not even really pregnant.

BOJACK: Jurj. He likes pranks, huh?
I'll prank him. I'll prank him real good.
We'll need to draw him out.
What do A-list actors like?

TODD: Stretch limos? Nannies?
Flying their private jets
to disaster areas so they can "help out"?

BOJACK: Yeah, limos. We'll get a limo.
I'll need one of those caps,
I'll be the driver.
I'll pick him up,
and he'll be all like, "I'm Jurj, I suck,"
and then I'll be all, "Surprise,"
and hit him with a bat.
Pranked!

TODD: It really doesn't seem like a prank
as much as you hitting him with a bat.

BOJACK: Yeah, it's a bad prank on purpose
to show how stupid pranks are.
That's the point.

TODD: Is that the point?

BOJACK: I'm working on levels here, man.
To the limousine repository.
Good afternoon, Mr. Clooners.
Of course. Bring the publicist.
Oh, shit.
I said, "Auschwitz."
You're the Nazi who played Yahtzee.
Uh... okay, yes, ma'am.
Here I go. Driving, driving.
I don't know
Okay.

DIANE: My concern is that you're
actually giving the pro-life movement
something to latch onto
as an example of--
You need to stop and think--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I am just here for emotional support.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane can you let it go?
I don't want to have to ask you again.

DIANE: I really think we have the chance
to say something here,
and all we're saying
is "Pshew pshew pow."

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What are you doing?

DIANE: That's the gun sounds, from the song.
Yeah, that's what I did. "Pshow, kapow."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Can everyone please
stop making gun sounds?
It is really freaking me out.

DIANE: My point is,
everyone's listening to you now.
Soon people are gonna get bored
and move onto the next thing
and you'll hate yourself
that you weren't able to make a difference
when you had the chance.
Believe me,
it happens sooner than you think.

BOJACK: Okay, we're here, finally. Get out.
That's it. Enough.
I am not your driver. It is I, BoJack.
Well I was gonna prank Jurj
by hitting him with this bat,
but you got into the car because,
apparently, you are a two-timing liar.
All this time,
I thought you believed in me.
This is why your clients win every year.
You represent everyone.
It has nothing to do with whether
you're a good publicist or not.
Not to me. You're doing great work
for this asshole who loves pranks.
Yeah, with a bad prank
to show how stupid pranks are.
No, it's a bad prank.
That's my point. Pranks are dumb.
Not my publicist. You're fired.
I do. I just did.
Not your problem.
Get the hell out of my limo.
'Cause I gotta pick up
a bachelorette party in 30 minutes.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

DIANE: What?
How are you going to have
an abortion on live TV
when you're not even
really having an abortion?
What does that mean?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, yeah. Fake abortion.
Movie magic, like in Argo.

DIANE: That is not what happened in Argo.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Alright I=if we're gonna do this,
we got to be real tasteful.
John Carpenter
can do the practical effects.
He owes me a favor.

DIANE: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: We'll book Eddie Redmayne as the fetus.

DIANE: Are you hearing yourselves?
We're not going to fake an abortion
on live TV.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well obviously, we'll pre-tape it.
Then put a little box in the corner
of the screen that says "Live."

DIANE: You don't think
this is incredibly disrespectful
to the women who actually get abortions?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane, this is what the client wants.
Stop making it about you.

DIANE: I'm not making it about me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I am so tired of you creating problems.

DIANE: I'm not--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm sorry you're so fertile
and in a sexually active,
loving relationship
and now you don't want a family.
I'm sure that's really hard for you.

DIANE: What?
Is there something you want to say to me?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I have given everything to get where I am,
and I am not about to throw all that away.
She wants an abortion?
I'm getting her an abortion.

DIANE: You know this is bullshit.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's all bullshit, Diane.
That's the gig. And you're not good enough
at this job to be too good for this job.

DIANE: I won't be a part of this.

BOJACK: All right, new publicist.
What do you got for me?

TODD: Secretariat was an athlete, right?
And you used to be an athlete.

BOJACK: What? No, I didn't.

TODD: You didn't play baseball and football?
Oh, um...
You know, I think I Googled the wrong guy.

BOJACK: Did you think I was Bo Jackson?

TODD: This idea I know you're going to like.
You know that car wash on Alvarado?
They need someone to dress up
like a gorilla and spin a sign.

BOJACK: Why would I do that?

TODD: Anything that gets your face
out there, right?

BOJACK: How does it get my face out there
dressed like a gorilla?

TODD: Maybe that one's a dud,
but hey, you think Lou Bega
knocked it out of the park
with "Mambo Number One"?
No, but he kept at it.

DIANE: I'm making things all about me?
I'm the one who's having an abortion.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's ridiculous.

DIANE: They're completely morally bankrupt.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I agree with you, 247 percent.

DIANE: I just wrote "morally bankrupt"
on this form.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And you were right to do that.
This form is being very nosy right now.

DIANE: Why did I even take that job?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You were going through a rough time,
Princess Carolyn wanted to help you
and she offered you the job.
Which she should not have done.
So morally bankrupt.

DIANE: Okay, yeah, that was nice.
But still,
she is putting her company's bottom line
before the very real damage
that bottle-nosed maniac
is doing every time
she gets on the news and--
That's it, the news.
I gotta take the high road,
go on the news and rat those suckers out.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Is that really a good idea?
I mean it is if you think it is,
because I am here to support you
no matter what,
but maybe it isn't the best idea?
Like, if that idea were a Dillon brother
maybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt?

DIANE: Someone has to tell the world
that Sextina is a total fraud.
Oh. Yeah, I mean, I work with her.
It doesn't offend you?
What about the part where she says,
"I hope and pray to God
my little fetus has a soul
'cause I want it to feel pain
when I eject it from my hole"?
Well, obviously.
No, I get it.
Yeah.

BOJACK: Ana?
You dropped Jurj?
Jurj Clooners?
Sexiest Man in America Jurj Clooners?
So nobody else, huh? Good.
Just all your hopes and dreams
pinned on me.
Somehow beating the odds
and winning the highest possible accolade
in an actor's career.
Just me, huh?
Wow, that's actually. That--
Is someone standing on my windpipe?
Let's just get Jurj on the phone so we--
Okay.
Whoa, Ana, what are you--?
Oh, boy.
Oh. Ana...
Okay, but--
Yes.
Ow, too tight.
Ouch! Oh, please.
Yes. God, yes.
Uh...

DIANE: That was surprisingly tasteful.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: And educational, right?

DIANE: Yeah. Weirdly educational.
I actually learned a lot about abortion,
and I just had an abortion.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: How are you feeling?

DIANE: I feel shitty.
I mean, physically.
I'm glad I did it,
but mostly I just felt old.
There were all these teenagers there.
Twenty-somethings.
I know from the outside, it might seem
like I should be ready for kids,
but I can't--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane, you don't need
to explain anything to anyone.
Sextina. Great job, we did it.

DIANE: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, we're gonna handle this.
Meet us at the office in 20 minutes.

DIANE: Okay girst thing is we gotta get her
out of town before she starts to show.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, we'll send her to that farm
where celebrities go to disappear,
where Chad Michael Murray
and Thora Birch went.

DIANE: We can film a bunch of music videos now,
and then--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Release them over the next year
so it seems like she's still around.

DIANE: Then when she comes back,
we'll say she adopted a baby.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: People are going to love that.

DIANE: Yeah. Everyone loves a baby.
