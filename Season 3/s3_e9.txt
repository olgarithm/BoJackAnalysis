PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack! Beautiful day, huh?
Perfect day to go outside,
not read the trades
or talk to anyone in the industry
or watch entertainment television
or have a gut feeling about the ratings
for your television show last night.

BOJACK: Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You read the trades.

BOJACK: My heart is in my stomach,
my stomach is in my butt,
and my butt ran away with the spoon.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That makes sense
because your butt is quite a dish.

BOJACK: Can you come over? I need you.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What the...?

BOJACK: I ordered a few feel-better pizzas
to feel better. It did not work.
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them,
and washed it all down
with a "Please, God, make my pain go away"
vermouth and ice cream float.
Somehow I feel worse.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That's a real mystery.

BOJACK: My show was terrible.
Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?
It's already an overused trope now,
in 2007.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey! Mockumentary is not a trope,
it's a device for storytelling.
And your show is daring and cutting edge.
People just aren't ready.

BOJACK: Yeah. Yeah, people! It's not me.
It's the people that are the problem!
Everyone's dumb and I am great.
Why do I always forget that?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That's the spirit.

BOJACK: I'm starting to think this show is
the best thing that happened to me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Really?

BOJACK: Yeah.
It made me realize you're the best thing
that happened to me,
with your sexy cat eyes
and your cute little hair curl.
You look like a soft serve
strawberry ice cream.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent.

BOJACK: You are so much more than that.
You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.
You're the little plastic table
they put in pizza boxes
to keep the pizza from getting smushed.
You're Princess Carolyn.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Don't you break my heart,
BoJack Horseman.

BOJACK: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What? Nothing.

BOJACK: Did you just say something to me?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, I was just being wistful, I guess.

BOJACK: Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?
Not everyone is interested in your wist.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, BoJack.

BOJACK: You smell nice.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Thanks, BoJack.
Okay, gotta go. I'm about to meet
my most important client.

BOJACK: I know you're not really on the phone.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Bye, Mr. President.
Give my love to your basketball friends.
You too.
So should we get dinner,
or are you just thinking drinks?

BOJACK: I'm not planning on staying long.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh okay.
I'm glad you wanted to meet,
because I am so pumped to tell you
all about the exciting projects
I'm lining up for you.

BOJACK: That won't be necessary.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Once you get your Oscar nom,
we'll have our pick. That's the key.
You think Halle Berry
would've been offered Catwoman
if she wasn't an Oscar winner?
We just gotta find you your Catwoman.

BOJACK: I'm not sure if a Catwoman
is really the best thing
for my career right now.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Right, well, like I said,
we are getting lots of offers.

BOJACK: Listen, Princess Carolyn--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Sandro, how you doing,
you handsome devil?

BOJACK: You mean sweating bullets?
How does sweating bull's nets
make sense?

BOJACK: Haven't you lived in America for 30 years?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ignore him. Why are you
sweating bullets and/or nets?

BOJACK: Critics are the worst.
That's my review of critics.
Two thumbs down! Four percent fresh!
One star! You all eat a flat butt!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Did you not know there was a critic here?
You own this place.
But I never see you do anything
to help run it.

BOJACK: This place runs itself. Right, Sandro?
See even his wife and kids
and therapy man agree.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So I know you're not happy about
what happened with the Kelsey project.
I get it- I pushed a little too hard to get you
the money you deserve.
What can I say? Sometimes I'm too good
of an agent, so deals fall apart.
That's a thing that happens
when agents are really good.

BOJACK: That's not--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Moving forward!
I know you're not happy
with how I handled Ethan Around.

BOJACK: Or didn't handle it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Bygones!
It was because I was busy
getting you the Pegasus movie,
which I know you did not get,
but trust me,
you'll see not getting these movies was
the best thing that ever happened to you.
Onwards and upwards!
Tally ho! To the stars!

BOJACK: Okay, you're forcing me to use the cards.
"Princess Carolyn, clear throat,
I have been very disappointed--"

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ring! Hello, Your Highness.
It's a king, I have to take this.
In the bathroom.
Oh, fish, oh, fish!
No.
All right, Pink Lady, think.
Are you a pink lady?
Were you Rizzo?
Well then don't waste my time.
So back to what you were--
Oh, my goodness, what is this?

BOJACK: Yeah, what is this?
Oh, my God.
You're making this up.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Can you believe it, BoJack?
It's been almost a quarter of a century.
Talking on the phone
pretty much every day,
sharing our deepest dreams and secrets,
being there for each other
through all of it, bosom friends,
Anne of Green Gables style.
Let's toast to another 23 years.
What do you say?

BOJACK: You're fired.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Uh-- Oh.
What? No.
No.
Honestly, just--
We're headed down a road that--
Okay well, now you are fired.

BOJACK: So that was weird, huh?
Please stop looking at me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Too bad about Sandro, huh?

BOJACK: You're the one who's fired, obviously.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Right.
Ryan Murphy is doing a re-imagining
of The Life and Times of Harriet Tubman.
But in this version, she's a tub-man,
with the comparative strength
and agility of a tub!

BOJACK: PC.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: He's looking for someone
to play the Underground
Railroad conductor.

BOJACK: Great, but you don't represent me anymore.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, I get it. I'm fired. Sheesk.
You're gonna spend a couple days
being mad at me,
then I'll get you another gig, and you'll
be my client again, just like every time.
Can we get past the part
where you're mad at me
and get to the part where
you're stealing General Lee's plutonium
to fuel your subterranean
steam-punk slave-tram?

BOJACK: "It's best, for both of us,
if we end this relationship
once and for all."

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm sorry I screwed up,
you don't have to read off the--

BOJACK: "You take me for granted, made decisions
that were against my wishes,
and worst of all
she's got my globes a-warming!"
How did that get in there?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What is that?

BOJACK: A punch line to a joke
from the roast of January Jones.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: A global warming joke?

BOJACK: It's an important issue. Here we go.
"Our relationship no longer has any--"
"January has only gotten hotter and hot--"
Nope.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Were you at the roast of January Jones?

BOJACK: No, but I wrote some jokes
in case someone got sick
and they needed a backup.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Do you even know January Jones?
Why would they call you?

BOJACK: I guess I thought that my agent could
get me in the mix if Jason Sudeikis--
How did these get out of order?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So in the joke,
are the globes your balls?
And they get warm
when you see January Jones?
Is that how balls work?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I don't know. It's a work in progress.

BOJACK: Professional integrity!
"Our relationship no longer
has any professional integrity.
So it's gotta end. Stand to leave."
Oh shouldn't have read that part.
"When you reflect on this,
you'll see it's best for both of us.
Exit restaurant." Goddamn it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wow, that was--
I don't know what that was.
Hey! Where are you going?
Who gave you this idea? Spanakopita?

BOJACK: This has nothing to do with Ana.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You two are b'thumping.
Now you do whatever she says?
Is that what's happening?

BOJACK: No.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, you're not b'thumping or no,
you're not doing whatever she says?

BOJACK: I'm not doing whatever she says.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So you are b'thumping.

BOJACK: I understand from context what you mean,
but there's no way b'thumping is a thing.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You don't have to do everything
your little falafel pocket tells you to.

BOJACK: You screwed up!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Once! In 23 years!
All these years I carried you,
when no one wanted to work with you.
I still managed to get you jobs.
And then you would flake,
or sabotage them,
or get wrapped up in some crisis
or emergency or vague sadness.
Everyone told me to dump you--
my bosses, film execs, directors,
they all told me you were washed up,
a nobody, a has-been,
a joke, too portly for TV.

BOJACK: Too portly for TV? Who said that?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It doesn't matter.

BOJACK: It does. Who said it?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Luis Guzman.

BOJACK: Luis Guzman said I'm too portly for TV?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're right, BoJack.
This is for the best.
I no longer have to lug your talentless,
self-centered, self-sabotaging,
dead-weight carcass
of faded talent around my neck.

BOJACK: Hey.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Thank you for firing me.
I'm gonna go pour myself
a little celebratory potato juice,
because this is the best goddamn
thing that's ever happened to me.

BOJACK: Hey! Hey! Hey!
You do not talk to me like that
and walk away.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, no? What's happening?
This is so weird. I'm walking away,
even though you told me not to.
Right, I don't work for you anymore.

BOJACK: Hey!
Not now.
Where is everybody?
Just do what you normally do.
Tonight's your lucky night.
You just got promoted.
You're the chef! Start cheffing!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What? Fifty teeth?
Get out of here. Let me see.
Would you look at that.

BOJACK: You're thrilled
to have me out of your life?
Because I was such a burden all those years.
Know what I think?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Don't wanna hear it.

BOJACK: I think you like being there to rescue me.
Nobody cares!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Nope, I'm still counting.

BOJACK: You like it when I'm a mess.
Because it makes you feel good
about yourself.
Guess what? I never asked for that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You ask all the time.
You have never not been asking me
to rescue you.
"Princess Carolyn, help me!
I slept with the gaffer's wife
and now he's not lighting me properly.
Princess Carolyn, I threw up
on Elle Fanning in a bounce house.
Princess Carolyn,
why am I such a big stupid asshole?"

BOJACK: Okay, great, more abuse.
Right on schedule.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, that's abuse?

BOJACK: "BoJack, you're such
a big, stupid asshole.
BoJack, why were you even
in the bounce house, dummy?
BoJack, you wasted my thirties!"

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I never said you wasted my thirties.

BOJACK: You didn't have to, you're always saying it.
And I don't like being around you,
because I feel bad.
You make me feel bad.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So this isn't about me being a bad agent.

BOJACK: It's about a lot of things.
Where are you going?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Away.

BOJACK: Oh boy. What? No.
What does that have to do--?
Who?
Alright that's enough out of you.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's all right,
you're gonna get through this.
You're gonna get through this.
Are you okay?
You've been in there a long time.

BOJACK: Just so you know,
this wasn't an easy decision.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: This is the ladies' room!
Are you watching a movie?

BOJACK: I agonized over this. Ask Ana.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh. So you did talk about it with Ana.

BOJACK: Well yeah. I respect her opinion.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Paws not claws! Paws not claws!

BOJACK: Hey! Ow! God, you're strong.
This is exactly the kind of
unprofessionalism I'm talking about.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You want to talk about professionalism?

BOJACK: Yes, I do.
But not here.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You say you want professionalism?
Bullshit.
You want a mommy
you can slide your dick in.

BOJACK: I can want that
and also want professionalism.
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries,
is that too much to ask?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Is there a single woman
you've worked with
who you haven't tried
to groggily thrust yourself into?

BOJACK: Is it any wonder
I don't want to be around you?
All you do is tell me
I'm a terrible person.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Please, you're such
a self-pitying masochist,
I could say ten nice things
and one mean thing,
you would only hear the one mean thing.

BOJACK: I'd love it
if you said ten nice things to me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I can say nice things.

BOJACK: Ready when you are.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Does self-pitying masochist count,
or are we starting from scratch?
Okay, one-- I'm freezing my whiskers off.
You have a natural charisma.

BOJACK: You hesitated, that means it's a lie.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Two, you are loved by millions.

BOJACK: That's not a compliment.
So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Number six.
You know how to make me laugh.

BOJACK: So I'm a clown to you?
Like Joe Pesci in Home Alone?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You recognize
you're being impossible, right?

BOJACK: I don't know how you put up with me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I didn't put up with you, BoJack.
I liked being with you.
And I don't regret it.
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.
Or the bracelet you bought me
for my 38th birthday.
Or when my dad died
and you came to the funeral
with me and held my hand.

BOJACK: I'm doing this for both of us.
You understand?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Did you ever love me? At all?

BOJACK: I don't-- I'm not--
You know that I don't do
the whole love thing.
Either you end up hurting someone
or they hurt you. So, what's the point?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah.

BOJACK: Ugh. This sucks. Ow.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I did this to myself. I do this to myself.
Why do I do this to myself?

BOJACK: I don't know.
I think maybe if you're good at putting out fires,
you just run from fire to fire
and don't really think about--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh no we gotta put out that fire!

BOJACK: Well this night has been a disaster.
It's called a char, dumbshits.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I know how.

BOJACK: What are you doing? No, go home.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're right. What am I doing?
All right.
Good luck.
Ugh. Who do they write these songs for?
Ugh.
Goddamn it.

BOJACK: How should I know?
Do I look like an expert in cooking oils?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Olive. You wanna use olive oil.

BOJACK: What are you doing?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Let me do this.
You'll burn the place to the ground.

BOJACK: Fine. This isn't one of those things
where you save my ass
so I feel obligated to give you
your job back.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Trust me I know you have no sense
of obligation to me.
The secret is stirring continuously.

BOJACK: Thanks for your help.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Sure.

BOJACK: How do you know how to do this?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.
She had a little trouble
bending her elbow too much. Glug, glug.
So unless I wanted us to be on the street,
I had to cover for her, a lot.
That rich family loved Italian food
and champagne fountains.
And cocaine. And private jets.
And screaming at each other.
"Who threw my cocaine
in the champagne fountain?"

BOJACK: So standard rich people stuff?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I guess.

BOJACK: How come you never told me that?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I did.

BOJACK: Oh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's okay. I know
you never remember anything.

BOJACK: That's not true.
I remember the first time we met.
I went to see Marv. You were
at the desk in front of his office.
I thought you were cute and you said,
"It's good to see you again."
Oh. So I guess we'd met before.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That was the third time we met.
The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.
You were passed out in the yard,
covered in tapioca pudding.
I hosed you down, dragged you inside,
covered you with a blanket.

BOJACK: Really? I don't remember that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Shocker.

BOJACK: So you've gone from daughter of a maid
to head of your own company.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, the company's not doing so hot.

BOJACK: Don't try to guilt me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's not your fault.
Turns out being an agent and running
an agency are two different skills.
It's like asking a really delicious tomato
to make you a tomato sandwich.
How's a tomato gonna make you
a sandwich? He's got no arms.

BOJACK: You'll figure it out. Princess Carolyn
always lands on her feet.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter?

BOJACK: Why are you an agent at all
if it makes you so miserable?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Because I'm good at it.
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.

BOJACK: Just 'cause you're good at something
doesn't mean you have to do it.
I'm good at driving sober,
but I don't relish the opportunity.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: But what else would I do?
Who else would I be?

BOJACK: I do love you, by the way.
I mean, as much
as I'm capable of loving anyone.
Which is never enough. I'm sorry.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ta-da!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So you'll give Elefante a good review?

BOJACK: A billion stars?
Oh, God, get out.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: How about a drink?

BOJACK: I could drink.
What's the second time we met?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I went to a taping of Horsin' Around.

BOJACK: Which episode?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: The one where Olivia put too much
detergent in the washing machine.

BOJACK: Nancy Reagan was the guest star.
That woman
was the real actor in the family.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I just started working for Marv.
so I went backstage to introduce myself.

BOJACK: And then what happened?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You told me you were too tired
pretending to be nice all night,
and I needed to leave you alone.

BOJACK: Oh.
I'm a real jerk, huh?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, but you're honest,
straightforward,
not fake nice
and don't beat around the bush.
Your heart is tender,
so you protect it from people,
but sometimes you open up a wall
and it's incredible.
You're doing the best you can,
considering your asshole parents.
You have great taste in art,
and that pink spot
on your nose is just adorable.
How many nice things was that,
about ten?

BOJACK: Yeah, just about.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, one more.
You let me help you tonight
because you knew I needed it.
You did it for me,
which was very sweet.

BOJACK: Thanks. You're a good friend to me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack...

BOJACK: Yeah?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Are we friends?

BOJACK: Yeah. I mean, I think we are.
Or I think we can be.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you...
Please don't leave me.

BOJACK: Princess Carolyn--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Please.
I can turn this around,
I just need more time.
We're in a fragile period,
still finding our feet.
Just give me six months
and then you can go.
I promise,
I'll never ask anything from you again,
but please, give me six months.
So? What do you think?

BOJACK: No.
