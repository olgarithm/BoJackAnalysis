PRINCESS CAROLYN: The next Pegasus.
BoJack's got star power and
grit up the wazoo. I can't imagine...
He's got sex appeal...
Gravitas...
Experience...
On the map.
The map of profitable agencies, that is.
The year's not over yet. We
still have one day to go all out.

BOJACK: Hey, Sarah Lynn.
I'm sorry, what thing?
Wait, slow down. Did
you say Ethan Around?
Hold on, if this was a real thing,
why would Brad call you and not me?
Are you sure this whole thing isn't
just a semi-lucid fever dream
from mixing the wrong pills?
Really? That's incredible.
What? No, just stay sober.
Well, that's troubling.
Can you believe they're doing a
Horsin' Around reboot without me?
Not the point. This is about respect.
You're doing a new show in
the extended Horsin' Around
cinematic universe
and you didn't call me?
So? We could write around that.
The Horse dying was just a dream.
The Horse had a twin
brother, comes back as a ghost.
Ethan missed the Horse so much he
built a robot Horse as a tribute.
"I've heard of overloaded
motherboards, but this is ridiculous."
Those are off the top of
my head, they're all gold.
I wouldn't say I'm attached...
Right now?
Is that a thrill you experienced?
Great.
Why did you let me call him?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ah, smell that Labrador Peninsula
air. Keep an eye out for my brother.

DIANE: How will I know which one's him?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: He's the one that looks like me.

DIANE: Got it.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hello?

TODD: Hey Mr. Peanutbutter! Is this an okay time to talk business?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, I'm just waiting for
Captain Peanutbutter.

TODD: What is that, like, a cereal?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, my brother.
He's picking us up at the airport.

TODD: Nice.
Speaking of driving people places,
Cabracadabra had a killer holiday season
and I think New Year's is
going to be even bigger.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm loving that segue, Todd. You
are a conversational Magellan.

TODD: Turns out there's a huge demand for
a safe space for women. Who knew?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Honestly, never
would've crossed my mind.

TODD: So I was thinking, what's the next step?
What if we made our
safe space for women...
also available to men?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's an untapped market.

TODD: All right, then it's agreed.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No goodbye?
He's a conversational Amelia Earhart.
Captain Peanutbutter,
you old so-and-so.
Get over here.

DIANE: Careful.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Where's Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter?
Diane, this is my big brother.
And you always will be.

DIANE: It's nice to meet you, Captain.
Oh!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So David Pincher is about to shoot
the Flight of the Pegasus trilogy
in New Zealand, and BoJack
is perfect for the lead.

BOJACK: If I'm doing that, I
conveniently won't be able
to do that dumbass Ethan Around show.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Use that when you
tell him I won't do it.
Why don't you tell him
you don't want to do it?

BOJACK I can't do that. I'm like a
father figure to him... by which I mean
I slept with his mother.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Gross.

BOJACK: No.
I slept with her 20 years
ago. She was young then, not gross.

BOJACK: Hey, loved you in The
Caveman's Valentine.
Nothing? The Caveman's Valentine?
Samuel L. Jackson had
that big beard? Look it up.
When you start laughing, call me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'll get it, Kalamata. Don't
get your pita in a wad.

BOJACK: Wow. Flight of the Pegasus.
This must be what Robert
Downey Jr. felt like
when he woke up on that
stranger's bathroom floor
and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, paradise.
Now who let these little
monsters onto my peninsula?
What? I don't remember my
nephews being made out of candy.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

DIANE: They're adorable, not that I
value them based on their looks.
Because, of course,
children in society today are
often reduced to their cuteness.
I can't wait to get to know
your children as people,
so I can specifically compliment
them individually
on the foundation of their characters.
Uh...
What?
Okay.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Pretty great, right?

DIANE: Did you tell your brother
about the A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The audition? No, I could
never tell him about that.
He thinks I'm
offer-only, it would break his heart.
Wait, what audition?

DIANE: No, the abortion.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, no. Should I have?

DIANE: He said some weird stuff to me earlier.
The kind of stuff you'd
hear in a sad Creed song.
Or a happy Elliott Smith song.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, he's probably just razzing ya, but
he's a good dog. All bark, no bite.
Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.
I guess in human terms it would be:
He's all talk, and no shooting
you with an assault rifle.

DIANE: Is that what you think humans do?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Am I wrong?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So when I found out that
the best assistant I ever had
was working for David Pincher,
I mean, what are the odds?
Did he hire you because of your
cute little Benjamin Button-nose?
Just an assistant? Laura,
assistants are everything.
You're the first people
in, the last people out.
You know everyone's real name,
age, nose, teeth, and tits.
You have power, because in today's
economy the only true
power is information.
I want you to use that power.
I want you to get your boss to
pick BoJack as his Pegasus.
I always believed in you, Laura.
do
you believe in yourself?
Will you do this for me?
I pushed so hard for
you. I did everything I could.
I mean, we gals gotta look
out for each other. Right?

BOJACK: So on the new show Ethan is the dad,
and he's raising three little horses.
You couldn't have told
me this over the phone?
The new year? That's tonight.
Did you talk to my agent by any chance?
She didn't call you?
I talked to her, and I don't
know if she wants me to do it.
You know how agents are.
Just remember, I'm not the bad guy here.
I think my schedule's gonna be
tough... Might be
going to New Zealand.
Those bastards got
my quote so damn high.
And I do want to do it.
You gotta get me out of this thing.
This asshole's giving me everything
I ask for. What a nightmare.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Just tell him you don't want to do the show.

BOJACK: I can't. It would destroy him.
Destroying people is
what I pay you to do,
so I don't think about
the people I'm destroying.
Do you not know what an agent is?

BOJACK: Kelsey? That's what I said when they
said you wanted to meet with me.
I figured you never
wanted to see me again.
Just so I understand the reason you think
I'm right for the role
is because I'm a big enough
star to secure funding?
You're really giving the hard sell here.
For work or, like, in general?
It's a Pegasus. Unicorns are for babies.
You're right, that one scene we
shot that didn't even make it
into the Secretariat movie was
the best thing I ever did.
Why am I wasting my
time with this other stuff?
Let's do it.
Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Is it the nobody's-gonna-see-it element or
the fact you'll be working for peanuts?
Yeah, well, that's great,
but I've been working all day on
getting him the Pegasus movie
that you said would show the
world he's a movie star.

BOJACK: I don't want that anymore.
I want to do something real.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You realize how much
money we'd be walking away from?

BOJACK: This isn't about
money. Doesn't matter to me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.

BOJACK: Right. So what's the problem?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'll see what I can do.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We got a regular Maya Angelou over here.
Oh, it's Todd. Gotta take this.

DIANE: Maybe you can call him back later?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd!

DIANE: Uh... I guess.
Cool fire pit.

TODD: So it turns out men love safe spaces
for women even more than women do.
You gotta read some of these
comments. Queefburglar69 says,
"These sexy lady chauffeurs always
get me where I need to go."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well that's unambiguous.

TODD: The only problem is some of the
drivers have been complaining
about the new customer base.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The workers are allowed to
complain? We gotta tighten up that ship.

TODD: Most of the new
passengers are perfect gentlemen,
but we've found that a growing
number are rating our drivers
not on performance but on "bangability",
which creates an unfair
advantage for our "bangable" drivers
and creates what some of
our more homely employees
have dubbed a hostile
sexy-ocracy. Whoa!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well hey, our first priority is
creating a safe space for women,
so if our women don't
feel safe in that space,
we should replace
them with women who do.

TODD: Where can we find women who
are comfortable
around gentlemen?
I know. A gentleman's club.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's perfect.

TODD: To Whale World.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I always knew you were a superstar.
Let's get drinks in the new year
and work out the deets... That's
a fast way of saying details
for people who don't have time for
every detail of the word details.
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.
I'm gonna bat her
around like a ball of foil.
Judah, this is where I
live. Watch and learn.
Great! BoJack would love to do the movie,
but you're gonna have to
work around his Pegasus schedule.
Then you're gonna have to
match his Pegasus quote.
Because he won't do it for a penny less.
Well, then, work around his schedule.
Oh I'm barreling towards you fast,
My court. My rules.
Bye.

BOJACK: Why is my house filled with sexy orcas?

TODD: It's the Cabracadabra New Year's
party. These are our drivers.

BOJACK: Oh. Uh, where's Emily?

TODD: She left. She said she
didn't feel comfortable here.

BOJACK: She certainly didn't feel
comfortable paying for the food she ate.

TODD: Yeah, okay, BoJack.

DIANE: Something is going on with your
brother. You need to talk to him.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We don't really have the
kind of relationship
where we talk about things.
Labs prefer to keep things playful.
You know what they say about
dogs? Talking to each other is rrruff.

DIANE: I'm serious, Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And I'm serious that you should drop it.
If something was really
wrong, he would tell me about it.

DIANE: Would he?
I know he's your brother, but
he's hiding something from you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Why do you think you know
my brother better than I do?
Just because you have a
shitty relationship with your family
doesn't mean every other
family has to have drama too.
I wanted to come up
here and have a nice time.
This place is an escape for me.

DIANE: Okay, I'm sorry, I just...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I should not have
shouted at you. I just...
I need to go for a walk.
Hey, is there something going on?
Because I know there isn't, but if
there is, you would tell me, right?
But there's nothing to tell,
because nothing bad ever
happens on the Labrador Peninsula.
Why?
I will not sit down.
Okay.
No.
But it's going to be fine?
Promise me it's going to be
fine? Because you're my big brother.
That means you can't
lie to me about this.
No, don't do this.
Please.
What is this, a very special episode?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What? What do you mean? What happened?
I don't understand, Laura. I...

BOJACK: Hey.
What are you talking about, I do want to do your movie.
What?
Kelsey, this is a mistake.
Huh?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack didn't book Pegasus.
That fell apart, too.
Jesus Christ do you ever read a room?
Is midnight on New Year's
a bad time? I don't know.
Why don't you run that
through your robot analysis protocol?
Get back to me once
you've assessed the data.
You want to make some cuts? Why
don't you cut that stupid beard?
Everyone who walks
in here thinks this
place is run by a
homeless person.
No, you're perfect. Everybody's
perfect except for me.
Go home, Judah.
Just go home, Judah.
