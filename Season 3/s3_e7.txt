TODD: Guys, I think we could use
another phone jack over here.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Can you toss me the thing?
Sorry. The other thing.

TODD: Okay. Watch the couch.

BOJACK: Hey. Goddammit!
Don't put me on hold.
Do you know who I am?
I just won a Baby's Choice Award,
the winner of which
has gone to take home the Oscar
seven of the last 15 years.
So, yeah, that BoJack Horseman.
Otherwise known as the guy you keep
sending your dumb newspaper to
even though I never subscribed to it.
I never subscribed to the L.A. Gazette.
I do not read the L.A. Gazette.
I have called this number so many times
to stop sending it to me.
Yet every morning, I open my door
on a new edition of the L.A. Gazette.
It's like I'm in a boring episode
of The Twilight Zone.
Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.
Uh... huh.
It wasn't a problem until recently,
because up until a week ago
the boy who lives with me used the paper
to make a giant paper-mâché Todd head.
I live with my best friend, Todd.
Good kid, but sometimes
he gets ideas to do things.

TODD: Pretty scary, right?

BOJACK: Yes. What the hell is that?

TODD: Giant Todd Head, of course.
I've been working on him
for the last six months.

BOJACK: What? Why?

TODD: It all started
when a rustling from the kitchen
jostled me from tender slumber.
Uh...
What was that?
If there's a ghost present,
please do not scream
or have a skull face or be wearing
a tattered white satin gown.
Someone or something is stealing our food.
I made a giant papier-mâché Todd head
to scare it away. Think it'll work?

BOJACK: If I made a giant papier-mâché me head,
would you stop eating my food?

TODD: You should take this seriously.
We might have an infestation.

BOJACK: We do have an infestation, of Todds.
Look at that, they're getting bigger.
No. Todd abandoned the project as soon
as he started working on Cabracadabra.
That's what I said.
What's Cabracadabra?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's what I said.
What's Cabracadabra?

TODD: That's what we want you to say.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: If I didn't know any better,
you were about to pitch an idea.

TODD: We are about to pitch you an idea.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I did not know better.

TODD: Has this ever happened to you?
Hey, where you headed?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, yes. That happens to me all the time.

TODD: No we're not at the main part yet.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: 'm so sorry. Please continue.

TODD: Okay.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Am I watching to see if the whole thing
has happened to me?
Or looking for one specific thing?

TODD: Kind of both.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So I just keep watching until I see
something that has happened to me?

TODD: Yes.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What if we get to the end,
none of it has ever happened to me?

TODD: Maybe just try to put yourself
in Emily's shoes right now.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Got it. Sorry for the interruption.
Please continue.

TODD: So, is this where you live?
Alone or are you in a relationship?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well this hardly seems appropriate.
Yeah, Todd. What are you doing?

TODD: Has a creepy driver
ever given you his number
or told you that you reminded him
of his dead girlfriend?
Or repeated your address slowly,
like he was trying to memorize it?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, never.

TODD: Unfortunately, if you are a woman
all those things
would happen to you every day.
But what if there was a ride-share service
that could guarantee
no creepy men drivers
because there are no men drivers at all?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What are you saying, robot drivers?
What if they become sentient
and try to murder us, or unionize?
That could be a real headache.

TODD: No, not murderous robots. Women.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd, you have done it again.

TODD: Actually, Emily and I
came up with it together.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Todd and Emily,
you've done it again for the first time.

TODD: And that's why we're setting up shop
at your house.

BOJACK: Wait why does it have to be my house?

TODD: There's no room
at Mr. Peanutbutter's house.
It's full of spaghetti strainers.

BOJACK: Why?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Who can recall?
I figure the longer they're there,
the bigger the payoff.
And they've been sitting there
for months now.
So you can bet
the payoff's going to be pretty huge.

BOJACK: I felt guilty.
Todd had this old girlfriend.
I met her a couple weeks back.
Hey.
What are you still doing up?
Then you came to the right place.
Should we call Todd,
see if he wants to join us?
And what do you want?
My kind of girl.
So then we had sex.
I was lonely? She was there?
Why does anyone have sex with anyone?
What?
Yeah.
Agreed. A wonderful, sexy mistake
for you and a regular mistake for me.
Nothing, obviously.
Yeah neither do I.
That's why we won't tell him.
That feeling is you selfishly
trying to assuage your guilt.
If you cared about Todd,
you would keep this a secret forever.
When you were a little girl,
did you ever do that thing you said?
I think it's gonna be fine.
Why would it even come up?
Not like there's any reason
the three of us
would ever be in a room together again.

TODD: Hey BoJack, you remember Emily, right?

BOJACK: No.

TODD: You don't remember BoJack?

BOJACK: Todd's house? This is my house.

TODD: It's cool if we set up shop here, right?
That's not gonna be weird?

BOJACK: What? Why would that be weird?
What are you implying?

TODD: Nothing.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay, what is going on here?

BOJACK: Literally nothing going on.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No, something's going on.
I've got a nose for news.
In this case, Nu is the Greek letter
representing the variable
for "What Is Going On?"
So let's solve for Nu, shall we?
I think someone's not saying something
to someone else about something.
I know what it is.
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.
No one wants to say it out loud
because we're afraid we'll jinx it.

BOJACK: Yes. Your stupid business
is gonna be very successful.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yes.

BOJACK: Glad that's out in the open.
We all know what everyone was thinking,
we don't need to ask
any more questions
or do any wondering about mysteries.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Nope.

BOJACK: If you'll excuse me,
I need to go watch a sport.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Great idea.

BOJACK: And you know the worst part is things have actually
been going really well with Todd.
Our friendship is in a really good place.
Last week he said,
"Did you know the wiener dog
is neither a wiener nor a dog?"
Instead of saying,
"Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.
Can't it just be that?
Yeah, you know, I think that you're
definitely hitting on something real
that I would love to drill down into,
but I gotta go
to this marketing meeting now.
Which is so annoying
because I totally want to keep talking
about that thing you're talking about.
But marketing meetings, right?
I mean, they're so important.
Can I call you back tomorrow?
Great. Bye.
Weird.

DIANE: Sorry I'm late.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's fine. We're just getting started.

DIANE: I had the worst morning.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.

DIANE: So I drove here, right?
I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage
when I realize I don't have my key card.
I gotta drive all the way home to get it.
When I got there,
I couldn't find it anywhere.
Suddenly, I remember:
I put it in the glove compartment.
It was in my car the entire time.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay.

DIANE: But then because I was driving back and forth
so much, I ran out of gas.
So I had to pull into a 76.
I was about to pump the gas,
I realized I didn't have my credit card,
when I remembered
it was on my desk at home
because I used it to contribute to
my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane...

DIANE: Oh, shit.
Yeah, but I don't like feeling
like I have to, Roxy.
Does the world need
a stop-motion short film
about a pig who goes to circus school?
Mmm... okay.
So I had to call a cab to take me home
to get my credit card.
Then back to the gas station, get my car,
fill it up and come here.
So that's why I'm late.

BOJACK: Why did you tell us that whole story?

DIANE: I don't know.

BOJACK: I don't know.

BOJACK: If everyone loves it,
why do we need a new ad campaign?
That's very considerate.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That's a good one.
The rest of these suck.
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.
Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.
Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.
I am really good at this.

BOJACK: Huh.
I kind of like this one.
It's actually really powerful.
I don't know.
All the pictures of me,
they looked backwards.
When I looked at the mirror ad,
I was seeing me as I see myself
and I thought
there was something beautiful about that.
Intimate, almost.
But you've got the heart of a champion.
Yeah but isn't that the point of the movie,
that anybody could be Secretariat?
Yeah, couple times.
We have a very complicated relationship.
It's complicated.
If our relationship was a Meryl Streep
movie, it would be Doubt.
Okay, you know, I gotta say
I don't feel like I'm in charge.
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are we
having sex in my car?
Can we at least go back to your place?
No because I don't know where you live.
You control every part of my life,
I don't know anything about you.
No, I do.
I want to be known and know others.
Better question:
Why am I still getting the L.A. Gazette?
No. I want to cancel my subscription
because newspapers are dumb.
I feel I'm very clear on this point.
Every morning,
someone knocks on my door and says,
"Throw away this garbage for me."
Well, I have had trouble sleeping.

TODD: You're silly.

BOJACK: Oh, God.

TODD: Okay, your turn, truth or dare.
What is the worst recent thing you did
to someone who cared about you?
Both.

BOJACK: Can you keep it down, please?
Some people are trying to sleep.

TODD: We are keeping it down.

BOJACK: You're basically shouting.

TODD: Do you want me to whisper? Like this?

BOJACK: No, because then I'll hear the
"psst, psst, psst."
And I'll be up all night
wondering what you're talking about.

TODD: Uh, what would we be talking about?

BOJACK: I don't know. Dumb stuff.
Forget it. Can't sleep here.
I'm gonna go sleep in my boat.
Character Actress Margo Mart--?
Is this one of those situations where
everything we discuss is confidential,
due to customer
service rep-client privilege?
Then yes,
Margo Martindale is living in my boat.
How long have you been in here?
I know what "lay low" means.
And you've been living here ever since?
The Good Wife?
How did you go on a nationally broadcast
TV show with no one catching you?
And you're the one
who's been stealing our food.
Why did you throw a plum on the floor?
Alright I'm gonna go sleep by the pool.

TODD: Hey. BoJack's back.

BOJACK: Yup.

TODD: My two favorite people
in a room together with me.

BOJACK: You bet.

TODD: Isn't this great, BoJack?
The three of us under one roof?
It's like Three Men and a Baby.
But there's only two men,
and the baby's a lady.

BOJACK: Uh-huh.
Let me tell you something
about the L.A. Gazette.
Oh, right. Well...
If we're gonna work together
and also have weird kinky car sex,
I wanna know something about you.
Gross, is that true?
Well, that worked.
That's how she left things.
But then I followed her home.
Turns out she lives in this
tiny apartment in the Valley.
I could see her through the window
and I just watched her being... normal.
But it wasn't good intimate,
like when you see your mom cry.
It was bad intimate,
like when your dad writes a poem
about Lena Horne's nipples,
makes you read it out loud
so he can hear if it scans.
Yeah. She was right.
It's so sad that when you see someone
as they really are, it ruins them.
About what?
No I don't know that joke.
Yeah. Psychiatrists are idiots.
What the... I'm on the phone.
On the phone.
I don't want to talk to anybody.
What I want is to have control
over my own life.
Which is why I'm begging you
to please cancel my delivery
of the L.A. Gazette.
I promise you I do.
Live inside the beast?
That's a mixed metaphor.
But... you're right.
Thanks.
You've given me a lot to think about.

TODD: Okay, so I'm a passenger.
Remember the three D's:
drive safely, drive efficiently,
and don't harass the passenger.
Sure. Driver, pull over, please.
Of course.
Driver, put up the partition, please.
What? But the whole point
is we're doing it together.
What's wrong with the house?
I don't understand.
Did I do something
to make you feel uncomfortable?
BoJack? 
What did he do this time?
Oh, okay.
No, no, no, keep your share.
Who knows?
It might be worth something someday.
Hey, you want this plum?
I found it in the kitchen.

BOJACK: Ana...
No, I know that it's exciting
to remain mysterious and in control,
but control is a myth.
That's a conclusion
I came to recently by myself.
I don't want to go home tonight.
I want to sleep in your bed,
I wanna see what
you look like waking up.
You are a beautiful,
sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.
And I want to know you.
I'm not afraid of that.
And you don't have to be, either.
And I want to go with the mirror ads
for Secretariat.
Ana.
This is my campaign,
I know what I'm doing.
I'm the star and what I say goes.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It kind of just looks like
a billboard for the sky.

BOJACK: Yeah I didn't think this part through.

DIANE: It is eerily beautiful.
Like an art piece
that resists interpretation.
I'd hate to be driving here at rush hour.
When the sun goes down
and hits that billboard,
that's gonna--
That's gonna be a real problem.
