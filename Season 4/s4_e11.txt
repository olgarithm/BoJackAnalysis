BOJACK: I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!
Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.
I'm the ball of gas!
Wait. Mom, do you remember--
Ugh!
No, we're going
to a glorious magical place
where they'll lock you
in a room by yourself
so you can't hurt anyone ever again.
Wait. You just said--
Yes, this is my mother.
I'd like to leave her here.
Can I pay for the next five years now
so I don't have to think about her again?
I'm not what?
Oh, once upon a time...
I'm not a baby. I'm six.
I'm forming sentences.
I didn't say your book is great.
Okay.
Bye, Mom.
I don't know why you don't
just get a divorce already.
That actually is a legitimate reason
to get a divorce.
What I did?
Sure.
I said I'll take it.
How long you sticking around for, Mom?
Yeah, let's get you good and liquored up
before you drive up the coast.
I got a date with Tonya Harding tonight.
She was the good one right?
I always get them confused.
Three years ago now.
You're really on the pulse, huh?
Some people like silly stories.
It's not Ibsen, but...
Well thanks for the painting.
It'll be nice to have something that
always reminds me of this conversation.
Best of luck. See ya never.
Bye, Mom.
Mom?
Yeah, it's me.
This is where you live now.
Mom...
I just told you.
You're...
in Michigan.
Yeah.
At the lake house.
It's a-- It's a warm summer night,
and the fireflies are dancing
in the sky.
And your whole family is here.
And they're telling you
that everything is gonna be all right.
The crickets are-- are chirping,
and the lake is still,
and the night is full of stars.
We're sitting on the back porch,
and we're listening to your brother
play the piano,
and we're eating ice cream.
Vanilla ice cream.
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?
