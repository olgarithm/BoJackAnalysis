PRINCESS CAROLYN: Don't worry about it. I feel great!
I just know you're gonna be
the next Joey K. Easter,
the guy who invented Arbor Day.
You'll think of something.
Give me just a sip of the coffee.
I can have a sip.
Today is going to be great.
Oh--!
Oh-hh!

BOJACK: Go for BoJack!
You like that?
I'm trying out some new phone stuff.
Or is "Bo for GoJack" better?
Nah, maybe too clever.
I don't want people to think I'm trying.
Sorry, who is this?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Princess Carolyn, moron.

BOJACK: Oh, hey, P.C. So what do you think?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: About what?

BOJACK: "Go for BoJack!" Or maybe--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ugh, stop!
You need to get a new agent.
I'm sick of fielding your offers.

BOJACK: Offers? Well, you tell them
that I am not doing another reality show.
So degrading.
All they had at craft services
was Kirkland snacks, P.C.  Kirkland snacks.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, first of all, I don't work for you,
so I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.
But, second,
these are actually good offers.

BOJACK: Really? Like what?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm not telling you because--

BOJACK: Got it. Busy, busy. I'm busy too,
so I'll call you back later. Bye.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Don't call me back. I don't work for you!

BOJACK: How's this for a headline for the blog?
You write about this, quote,
"BoJack Finally Solves Mystery
of Hollyhock's Mother,
comma, Looks Handsome,
colon: Is Cool." End quote.

DIANE: I still don't understand your plan,
or how that's a headline.

BOJACK: The plan couldn't be simpler.
Go to the county courthouse,
ask to see all the birth certificates
on file, find Hollyhock's,
see what it says in the "mother" spot.

DIANE: They're not just gonna give you
the birth certificates.

BOJACK: Well, I gotta try something.
I have this girl at my house
who came to me for help,
I want to do right by her.

DIANE: I just don't know
if you've thought through--

BOJACK: Diane, I am a famous.
They will give me the birth certificate.
Everyone gives me everything I want
all the time.
It is an existential curse,
but a huge day-to-day convenience.

DIANE: So why do you need me?

BOJACK: I don't know. Just wanted some company.

DIANE: You told me to use a vacation day
because this was, quote,
"a feminism-related emergency."

BOJACK: I got your number!

DIANE: Why didn't you just bring Hollyhock?

BOJACK: I was gonna, but she got really
into counting her teeth this morning,
didn't want to leave the house.
You know how teens are.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Corpse Me If You Can-Can , the 1940's
Cannes, France-set story
of a can-can dancer who contracts cancer
but continues to can-can
as a canny cadaver
who plays the accordion
with Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Kline,
Chris Klein, Chris Pine and Chris Kattan.
Gekko.
You look tired, "Veronica."
Did Chris Kattan drop out?
Right before his comeback?
Right when the world is finally ready
to settle for Kattan?
I'm  fired?
Who knew Portnoy had so many complaints?
Oh, just give me one more chance.
I promise I can get you the lead
in that can-can cadaver movie.
You did play the short-sighted seamstress
in The Storm on Northern Fortress.
Aw.
Oh, uh--
Thanks, Judah.
You know, one year ago,
a setback like this
would have really spun me out.
But I don't need Courtney.
Every time we fall, we get back up
stronger and better than ever.
Can I get a hallelujah?
Great. What's next?
Don't know what I'd do without you,
my hairy number two!
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
That came out horribly.
Ugh!
BoJack is off the table.
We're a small management company.
We just need to focus
on the clients we have.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Mo for Gister Peanutbutter!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, handsome. Heard you dropped out
of the governor's race.
Now let's get you back to work
on what really matters-- show business!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm going to stop you right there.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I was done.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I can't wait to get back
in front of the camera,
but right now, I have to help my former
political rival defeat my two ex-wives.
One of whom is in the pocket
of powerful lobbyists
and the other of whom
murdered popular actor
and soundtrack artisan, Zach Braff,
and ate his burnt flesh!
Politics as usual, right?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, when you're ready to work again--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Gotta go. They need all hands on deck,
because Woodchuck
lost his hands underground
and they replaced them
with creepy lobster claws.
Typical politics!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey. So I need this clasp replaced,
24-karat gold.
This is a priceless family heirloom.
Thank you.
Charley?
No, I own my own management company.
Your approval means nothing to me.
What offer? I mean, exactly what offer
are you talking about?
I get so many.
Judah.
Oh, right. That offer.
Well, yeah. Because I wasn't,
and he does what I say.
Yeah.
Judah, you'll never guess
who I just ran into.
It was Charley Witherspoon!
Char... ley...
Wither... spoon!
How does that make you feel?
So, what's next, then?
Ooh, I want to get the life rights
to that woman I saw on Instagram
who had a pretty coffee.
I bet we could attach Jessica Alba
and Jonathan Taylor-Thomas by lunch.
And finally, Rob Lowe.
But is it possible you've forgotten
your doctor's appointment?
Oh, fish!
Thank you, Judah! I'll call you
if I think of any more actor names.

BOJACK: God, this is taking forever.

DIANE: We've been waiting for 15 minutes.

BOJACK: I know. Let's just go home.
No, Diane.
How could you even suggest that?
This is not about us.
This is for my daughter.

DIANE: Ugh.

BOJACK: I know what I have to do.
Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.
Important celebrity doing the right thing.
Hello, friend.
Yes, it's me, BoJack Hor--
I'm sorry, I don't give out
my personal phone number.
Horseman. It's Horseman.
I don't look familiar to you at all?

DIANE: Come on, BoJack. Let's get a number.
Oh, wow, thanks! You didn't think
20 was too many reasons?
Didn't I say it would?

BOJACK: We don't have time.
Where do we get a number?
What?
Ow, paper cut! Who still uses paper?
Can't I just swipe an app or something?
Oh, get over yourself.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So? What's the prognosis?
Wait, what?
Well, how do we make it viable again?
How did this happen?
Oof!
This is... a lot.
What do I do next?
No, I'm okay. I don't need anyone.
Hey, is my necklace ready?
Oh?
No, it's very expensive.
But, it's from the old country.
It's been in my family for generations.
Wha-- huh?
Oh-hh!
Oh!
Ralph, hey!
The doctor's appointment got pushed back.
I'm actually just walking in now.
Oh, hello. Yes, it's me, Princess Carolyn,
here for my appointment.
I like your perfume.
There is a painting of a lake on the wall.
Ralph, it's fine. I'm a big girl.
Yeah, easy. 
That's what the boys in high school
liked about me, too.
I love you, too.
No. Thank you.
You don't always know
what's best for me, Judah.
Charley Witherspoon
made you an offer to buy Vim,
and you went over my head
and turned him down without telling me.
So it's true. You lied to me.
Because you didn't want to work
at a big agency.
You don't fit in with other people.
You're weird, so you'd rather stay here
where you have all the power.
So you lied to me,
and you made me look like an idiot!
I don't need you to protect me.
Well, that's not your decision to make.
No.
If I can't trust you,
then I can't work with you.
You're fired.
Thank you, Judah.

Error. Error.

BOJACK: I'm not leaving
without the certificate!
I danced your dance, lady.
I filled out that form.
But I will not wait in this line anymore.
Not one person in here
offered me a Fiji water,
and I am parched
from all the yelling I've been doing!

DIANE: BoJack, let's go home.

BOJACK: No, I would like to register
a formal complaint.
How do I do that?
You have won this round.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, so you'd give that card
to a paperweight?
That Kerry Washington has really brought
red wine into popularity.
Ugh.
You know it.
Aw-ww...
Well, the doctor didn't have much info.
You know how doctors are. But he did say
there's nothing wrong with me, so--
Ooh!
Agh!
Ugh!
I have to go.
No, it's fine.
I'll just meet you at home.
Oh!

TODD: Oh, hey, Princess Carolyn.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What is going on here?

TODD: Only the future.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: This is horrifying
and it doesn't look legal,
but whatever it is, you'd better
cut me in for ten percent.
Whose kid is that?

TODD: Look, if you didn't want me
to turn your apartment
into a base of operations
for my new clown-dentist venture,
you should have specified that
when I moved in.
Oh, no! He's waking up.
Hit him with the giggle gas!
Oh!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: All right. You're clearly doing
important work here.
I'm just gonna have a quick nightcap
and go to bed.

TODD: Hey, what happened to your necklace?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, fish! Fish, fish, fish, fish.
It must have fallen off!
Yeah, just a second!
Todd, get these clowns outta here!

TODD: Go, go, go, go.
Scatter, clowns!
Into the night! Go! Go!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Go, scamper! Everybody, out!

TODD: Ugh!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay.
Oh, thank God!
Aw, you was worried?
That hipster Chewbacca,
always getting in my personal biz-natch.
Okay, what? Third degree much?
It's fine, okay?
I get to drink because baby went gone!
"Gone, baby, gone."
Like that Ben Affleck movie.
That could be a sequel.
Gone, Baby, Never Was.  Write that down.
It's okay! You know me.
I always land on my feet.
Take a lickin', keep tickin'.
Like a lollipop with Tourette's.
Write that down.
Is that what you're upset about?
That I lied?
About losing the baby?
About keeping my apartment?
I lied? That's the big sad thing
that happened?
It's gonna be fine.
I'll be pregnant again in no time.
I'm ready!
I said I was ready.
I don't need other options.
My mother had 12 kids.
My body was made for this.
We just gotta keep tick-tick-tickin'.
Five!
I've had five miscarriages.
One last year, now one,
and three others before.
But it's whatever. It's okay.
Are you kidding?
I don't want you looking at me like that.
Like that! I know I can do this.
It's not about you.
You're not allowed to be mad at me.
This is my bad day.
It's so easy for you...
to love me when everything's good.
No.
You need to live in this.
You need to get used to this,
because if you're serious about having
a baby with me, this could happen again.
Are you prepared for that?
This could happen five more times.
But I'm ready for that.
Because I want this.
Do you want it that bad?
Okay. Here's another option.
Get out of my apartment!
Get out! Save it for your next girlfriend.
The one you can take home to your parents.
The one who's easy.
What is it?

BOJACK: I'm calling about the offers.
I don't want to do 'em.
What's the point of being famous
if you wait in line?
If you could politely decline
on my behalf--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I do not work for you, BoJack!

BOJACK: I'm sorry. I started this all wrong.
How was your day?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well--

BOJACK: Because mine was awful.
I mean, truly, one for the books.
Because I'm a good guy
trying to do the right thing.
First, I go for my breakfast Pinkberry,
which I had earned
because I had good intentions for today,
they're out of my favorite toppings!
So I go across the street to Menchie's,
like some kind of hobo.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mm-hmm.

BOJACK: At Menchie's, the stupid teen that
worked there raised her eyebrows at me.
"You kidding me?
You're trying to judge me?
You have very uneven eyebrows
and you work at a Menchie's."
And don't even get me started
on the rancid internment camp
that is the L.A. County Courthouse.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, you wanna know what I do
when I have a really bad,
awful, terrible day?

BOJACK: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I imagine my great-great-great
granddaughter in the future
talking to her class about me.
She's poised and funny,
and tells people about me
and how everything worked out
in the end.
And when I think about that,
I think about how everything's
going to work out.
Because how else could she tell people?

BOJACK: But it's... fake.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, well... it makes me feel better.
