BOJACK: Whew.

DIANE: BoJack?

BOJACK: I'm back in L.A.
I should have called you--

DIANE: Yeah. You should have.

BOJACK: I said I was sorry.

DIANE: No, you didn't.
Okay. Good to hear from you, BoJack.

BOJACK: No--

DIANE: Ugh.

BOJACK: What the...?
What's going on here?
All right, I'm just gonna--
Uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: BoJack!
I love your ironic take
on black-tie attire.
It really says,
"I truly don't care what you think of me."
Ah, sorry about that.
Gotta raise those funds.

BOJACK: Can't I just--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Thanks for your support, buddy.
Means so much. Erica!

BOJACK: Hey--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Look at you,
with the right number of ears!

BOJACK: Look, I just--

DIANE: Hmm...!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh.
Hey, do you have another bathroom?
They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.
Not because I'm pregnant or anything.
Because if I were pregnant, it would be
bad luck to tell you this early.
Presuming it was early.
But I'm not pregnant.
This is just a normal,
non-pregnant gal type of having to pee.

DIANE: There's a bathroom in the pool house.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You're a lifesaver.
Pardon me! Out of my way.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uh-oh. Am I in Ithaca?
Because you are looking
"gorges" this evening.

DIANE: Well, I must be in Nazi Germany,
because you're "not so" bad yourself.
I'm sorry, yours was better.

BOJACK: Hi.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Whoa.
Well, I should go.
Looks like the work wife/ex-wife
is talking to my other ex-wife.

BOJACK: You have two ex-wives here?

DIANE: Katrina's his campaign manager.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And Jessica Biel loves
getting photographed at fancy fundraisers.
If it isn't my two favorite ladies,
in the same room! This is great.

BOJACK: Hey.

DIANE: BoJack, I'm busy.

BOJACK: You haven't seen me for a year and a half.

DIANE: Yeah, because you disapp--
No, I am not doing this now.
Why don't you get yourself a drink?

BOJACK: I will get a drink.
I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Everyone? Thank you all for being here.
We're gonna beat that scoundrel
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz...
...and bring likability back to politics.
I especially want to thank my pro-fracking
pals for being here tonight.
You know, my wife said, "Don't frack,"
but we did it anyway,
and it all worked out.
Love you, sweetie.

DIANE: Mm-hmm.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Finally-- oh!
Sorry about that, folks.
I sensed an earthquake.
Must have been a false--
Oh, hey now!
Nope, I was definitely wrong.
Listen to me,
I'm the dog who cried earthquake.

BOJACK: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

DIANE: I regret  everything!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Whoa!
Okay. Everyone, remain calm!
No one's going to light anyone on fire.
For one thing,
that'd eat up a lot of oxygen
and who knows
how much we have down here.
You okay, sweetie?

DIANE: I think so.
That was really scary.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah.
At least we know no one
is specifically at fault.
Well, except for San Andreas.

DIANE: This was because you fracked
under our house.
I told you fracking was dangerous,
and you didn't listen.
And now our house is ruined
and we're trapped underground,
and we're all going to die!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Is this one of our sexy fights?

DIANE: No!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hmm.

DIANE: Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

BOJACK: You can be mad at me or get drunk
with me, but you can't do both.

DIANE: Watch me.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, what the shit?
Oh, fish.

TODD: Uh... hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What are you doing in there?

TODD: Uh, I live here.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Didn't you know
there was a huge party going on?

TODD: I was going to go to the party
after my bath,
but then I realized
the bath was the party.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, God.
Well, I'm not waiting around
to be rescued like some chump.
Come on, let's go.

TODD: Whoa...!
We gotta go in there?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, I don't see any other way.
Sometimes life is like the second season
of Friday Night Lights --
you gotta push through
and hope there's better stuff ahead.

TODD: Aw-ww!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Guys, let's all try to just stay cool
and make the best of things, huh?
So that's a re-up on the idiot part?
This is true.
But most of us are important celebrities,
so someone will come for us soon.
And for you regulars,
I'm sure they'll bring you up with us!
We're actors! I say we put on a show.
Who's with me?
Sure you'll be the star,
and you'll be the star!
And you'll be the star!
We'll all be the star!
Folks, I promise you
we will be out of here in no time.
Thank you, Phoebe, for that rousing
Tale from the Above Ground.  Who's next?
It's only been 72 hours.
Come on, party people, keep it together.
Let's not forget why we're here--
to raise money for my campaign,
and more recently, to not go crazy
and murder each other.
You're killing me, Zach.
Yeah. You're right. I've totally got this.
What in the world?
Oh, thank God. A leader.

BOJACK: Sh.

DIANE: What's going on down here?
Anyone's looking for us?
We're cool. Just being cool, don't worry.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, have you just been getting drunk
with BoJack this whole time?

DIANE: What? I'm still mad at you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, that's what I've been saying!
Oh, yeah!

DIANE: Is that what a woodchuck is?
Why did I think it was like a beaver?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What's it like out there, Woodchuck?
Whole neighborhood totaled?
Is the city in chaos?

DIANE: Oh! Interesting!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ay-yi-yi.
Three cheers for Woodchuck!
Let's cheer one more time, just for fun!
Four cheers. Why not? Hip, hip...
So turns out three cheers was probably
an adequate number of cheers.

TODD: What was that?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Just keep walking.
God, I can't wait to get home.

TODD: I don't even have a home anymore.
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all
my different colored hats I never wear?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, if you need another couch
to crash on, there's always my place.

TODD: Didn't you move in with Ralph?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.
Just in case, I guess.

TODD: In case of what?
What was that?
Whoa!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh!
Now, ladies, just calm down.
We can talk about this.

TODD: What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That's just my name. I'm a manager.

TODD: It's like an agent.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's totally different.

TODD: Is it, though?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Mm-hmm.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, I can dig!
For you, a banana
because you're so appealing.
And for you, a radish. Enjoy.
I don't think so.
I'm food captain, and I am loving it.
Woodchuck.

BOJACK: I'm a horse. I need more food,
and I'm a celebrity.
Not the caterers.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house
and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.
Yeah, who made you leader
of underground?

BOJACK: I'm just gonna take all this and...
Weird stuff going on downstairs.
Humph.

DIANE: I can't believe this is my life.

BOJACK: Uh-oh.
Too much sad booze for you.
Where's the happy booze?

DIANE: I'm trapped underground
and it's all my husband's fault
and I'm gonna die in this mansion
in a mass grave with his ex-wives.

BOJACK: Okay. But on the bright side--
Look, Mr. Peanutbutter loves you,
you got a cool job, you got friends.

DIANE: Jesus, you're right.
Even when I was above ground,
I wasn't satisfied.
Oh, my God. I'm the problem!

BOJACK: Whoa!
What the...?

DIANE: Why can't I be happy? Am I busted?

BOJACK: No. It...

DIANE: I am! I'm a pit.
I'm a pit that good things fall into!

BOJACK: Diane, you're not a pit.

DIANE: I'm a pit!
I can't believe I'm crying.
This is so dumb.

BOJACK: It's okay.
Don't feel bad about feeling bad.

DIANE: You disappeared for a year and a half.

BOJACK: So you do want to talk about it.
Just took four solid days of drinking.

DIANE: If you were back in L.A.,
why didn't you call me?

BOJACK: I wasn't... ready.

DIANE: Ready? For what?

BOJACK: I wanted to be better
when you saw me again.
And I thought I could be, somehow.
But I'm not.
And even if I did get better,
the best I could ever be
is still just some other version of me.

DIANE: BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.
I need you in my life.

BOJACK: Really?

DIANE: You're the biggest asshole I know,
and you're the only thing
that makes sense to me.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: People should be able to have
some control over their lives down here.
And I'm the good guy,
so that's two points for me.
Well, maybe there should be points.
People seem to like my points idea.
That's another point for me.
Asking for points is conceited.
That's more points for me.
Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy
is as broken as his hands.
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.
An outsider like me,
the guy whose house this is.
Me!
Me!

DIANE: BoJack. BoJack.
BoJack.

BOJACK: What?

DIANE: Did you know I can juggle?

BOJACK: Cool.

DIANE: Are you okay?
I mean, outside of our current situation
of being buried alive
and almost out of alcohol
except for cooking sherry and Midori?

BOJACK: It's just been a rough couple years
with Sarah Lynn dying and Herb.

DIANE: And Corduroy?

BOJACK: Cordu-what now?

DIANE: Corduroy? Jackson-Jackson?
Died of autoerotic "asphyx-ization"?

BOJACK: Oh, yeah, him too. And now I got this...
girl in my house, this... daughter-type.

DIANE: You got daughter? Ruh-roh.

BOJACK: Yeah, I got daughter, "ruh-roh."
Supposed to help her figure out
who her mother is.
But I don't know where to start.

DIANE: Did she try sending mutual consent form
to the adoption agency?

BOJACK: What, what words?

DIANE: Well, if it's closed adoption,
you send a mutual consent form.
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"
If Mom says same thing,
boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame!

BOJACK: How do you know about that?

DIANE: I had an adopted brother.
And also for a while,
I hoped I was adopted.
Ugh!

BOJACK: Huh.

TODD: Whoa!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ooh!
My name is Princess Carolyn.
I represent the soldiers
of Subcolony K-147,
who feel they're doing all the work
while reaping none of the spoils.
I had this same conversation
with Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Believe me, this doesn't end well
for you.
They want to have sex with your drones.
Mm-hmm.

TODD: Uh, If we're gonna be down here a while,
can I get a new towel?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Thank you!
All right, guys, all right. Calm down.
We don't need to "get him."
Let's just tie him up someplace
where he can't hurt us anymore
with his dangerous ideas.
Thank you, thank you all.
As my first act as President-for-life,
I declare that everyone
is allowed to eat and drink
whatever they want!
Let's listen to the guy
who's saying don't kill me.
He's got some interesting ideas.
Oh, my God.
Jessica, no.
No.
No! No! Please!
Listen to reason... this time!

BOJACK: Ah-hh!
I think that's all of it.

DIANE: I can't go back to my old life sober.
It's so empty.

BOJACK: Okay, okay.
Here's the secret to being happy.

DIANE: Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

BOJACK: Just pretend you are happy, and eventually
you'll forget you're pretending.

DIANE: Maybe you're right.
I just need to stop complaining
and work harder.
Everyone else is doing it.
Why am I so special?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Please! Diane, my sweet wife.

DIANE: What's going on?

BOJACK: Marvin Gaye.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The People of Underground
have a new god, the fire.
And for my crimes
I will be fed to its ravenous flames.
My only hope is the meat
of Zach Braff proves lasting,
but I fear by daybreak,
there will be no Braff meat left.

DIANE: What's going on?

BOJACK: Four Non-Blondes.

DIANE: No!

BOJACK: Easy on the merchandise!

DIANE: Get off me!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, it's been a tough week,
lots of back and forth,
but I think we've reached an agreement
that meets everybody's needs.
My clients are satisfied with those terms.

TODD: Great. Now can we please return
to the surface world?
All my favorite clouds are up there.
We were at this big
Beverly Hills fundraiser.
There was an earthquake,
and now everyone's trapped underground.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey! Hold on.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Uhh..

DIANE: We gotta do something.
Mr. Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty
thing that's ever happened to me
and now they're gonna set him on fire.

BOJACK: Okay. What would non-hungover Diane do?
She's smart.

DIANE: I don't know. I need water.

BOJACK: "Choodwuck" is right.

DIANE: Wait, isn't there water, under the ground?
Like, a well?

BOJACK: Yeah! And we're underground.

DIANE: If we dig, we'll get water!

BOJACK: Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yes, if I could just say,
"Don't light me on fire"?

DIANE: Water!

BOJACK: Clear gold!
H-2-Oh, boy, we hit the freaking jackpot!

DIANE: Which is great!

BOJACK: H-2-Oh, no!
Well, I guess this is it.

DIANE: How is this happening?

TODD: Okay.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay.

DIANE: Hi.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hi.

DIANE: You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
I don't tell you that enough.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's okay.

DIANE: If this governor thing
is really important to you...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's not. You saw me in there.
I'm a terrible leader.
I don't want to be governor.
I just wanted people to like me.

DIANE: Well, I like you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Come on, Diane, let's go home...
oh, right.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, thanks for inviting me
to your party.
I had a wonderful time.
Evening really flew by.

DIANE: Sure.

BOJACK: You guys hungry?

TODD: I could eat.

BOJACK: Ethiopian?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ooh, haven't done Ethiopian in a while.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I should go home.
I haven't seen my boyfriend in ten days.
He's probably worried about me.

TODD: I'm down for Ethiopian.
I love that sponge bread.

BOJACK: Yeah what do they call it, "injera"?

DIANE: Yeah, injera.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Injera, right.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: That's right.

BOJACK: Yeah, that's good bread.
