BOJACK: Piece of shit.
Stupid piece of shit.
You're a real stupid piece of shit.
But I know I'm a piece of shit.
That makes me better
than all the pieces of shit
who don't know they're pieces of shit.
Or is it worse? Breakfast.
Oh, I don't deserve breakfast. Shut up.
Don't feel sorry for yourself. What does that do?
Get breakfast, you stupid fat-ass.
These are cookies. This is not breakfast.
You are eating cookies. Stop it.
Stop eating cookies,
go make yourself breakfast.
Stop it. Don't eat one more cookie.
Put that down. Do not eat that cookie.
I can't believe you ate that cookie.
For the what?
What baby?
Shit.
I don't want her driving my car,
getting her grubby hands all over.
She's not grubby, she's your daughter,
you piece of garbage.
You're a piece of garbage,
a real shitty piece of garbage.
Uh...
Think, idiot. If she takes the car,
you're trapped here with Mom
and her spooky lazy eyes.
But if you get the milk
and leave Hollyhock with Mom,
she could tell things about you,
poison your daughter against you,
that what you want?
Okay, how about, um... Hold on.
Oh shit they're looking.
Say something dumb-dumb!
Open your idiot dumbass mouth!
I will get milk.
Milk, milk.
What are they talking about now?
Probably you and what a dumb piece
of trash you are, you fat sack of idiot.
Why not do the world a favor
and swerve into oncoming traffic?
No, you don't deserve to die young,
only the greats die young.
Oh, now you think you're young
all of a sudden?
One drink.
Whoa. Is it night suddenly?
Suddenly sundown.
Suddenly "Sooze-town."
What was that show?
"Suddenly Sooze-town?"
Brooke Shields... something?
Show was on for five years and now
nobody-- Oh, my God, is that life?
You're there, you do your thing,
and then people forget.
"Forget it, Jake. It's Sooze-town."
Is that me?
Am I the Suddenly Sooze-town of people?
Shit.
Oh, shit. You gotta drive.
Sober up, buddy.
Here we go, sober... now!
Sober, now!
Come on, you drunk piece of shit,
be less drunk.
Now! Okay.
Idiot. What'd you do all day?
Piece of shit.
That's a day you'll never get back.
What was that? You're a real piece of--
Uh...
Uh...
Stupid piece of shit.
Oh, God. 
Well, it's about time someone
pulls their weight around here.
Okay, that's enough from you.
Is my house
on a slant or something?
I'm gonna go.
Great pitch, love your energy.
It's a pass.
What are you doing?
Go home.
You're parked on Mulholland doing nothing,
you could be eating breakfast
with your long-lost daughter
and dying mother.
You are a terrible person.
He gets it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I know,
I wanted to tell you right away.
Oh, I gotta go. See you tonight.
If it isn't my favorite client,
Courtney Portnoy,
and also another client, Todd.

TODD: It's always nice to be included
in a sentence someone says.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So bad news first:  Ms. Taken
was a miserable failure.
But Courtney, more importantly,
audiences are going to adore
your tour de force performance
as the forceful denim-clad court reporter
in The Court Reporter Sported Jorts,
the jet-setting jort-sporting
court reporter story.
No! Courtney! Before you fire me--
Oh, good. Yeah, agents are replaceable.
A manager is forever.
That's the takeaway here.
Love her already. Who is she?
Yes, he, he, ha, ha.
Now tell me her name.
Oh, fish.

TODD: Whoa!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Today? That's today!
You're right.

TODD: Being engaged is one thing,
but I'm not sure
I want to actually get married.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: We can draw up a standard
Hollywoo sham-marriage contract:
three years, non-exclusive, huge payday.

TODD: Oh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay.

BOJACK: Idiot. Stupid animal. Oaf.
Who are you talking to?
Baby?
Mom is "totes" into a baby?
Is it possible the baby
got dipped in brandy at some point?
Or cigarettes, or regressive ideas
about immigrants?
You shouldn't indulge her delusions.
It's not right.
It was getting depressing to look at her.
That's why I made her this pillowcase.
You just put this over her head
and everything is fine.

TODD: Oh, I actually have a big announcement.
I'm marrying Courtney Portnoy
this weekend.
I know it's pretty wild for an asexual
to get married, but...
Really?
Why nautical?
Is that, like, an asexual thing?
But involving boats?
So, it's not weird
for an ace to get married?
I will! I mean, I am. I mean, am I?

BOJACK: You stupid garbage fire.
Everything sucks.
Yeah, making breakfast
at three in the afternoon. So with it.
Don't say that.
Lousy baby.
What did it ever do that was so great?
Am I jealous of a doll?
Maybe if that doll wasn't so smug,
looking at me with its creepy doll eyes...
She's tricking you, Hollyhock.
This is not what she's really like.
She's right.
Wrong. She's in there.
She knows exactly what she's doing.
Where was that keen parenting insight
50 years ago?
I'm unfit?
It's true, jackass.
You think it's so hard
to be a parent to a doll? I could do that.
Hey, look, I'm cradling the baby.
Hope I don't drop it!
Oh, no! I dropped it, but it's not crying.
Guess it's okay. I'm an amazing parent.
What if I left it in its room all day
and didn't feed it or change it?
Oh, that's okay, too.
I must be mother of the year!
I know! What if for 18 years straight
I just tell it how worthless it is
every day, how it embarrasses me,
how my life would be better
if it was never born?
Would that be a good idea?
Probably, right?
Oh, so you  do  know who I am.
Hey, you think the baby would be okay
if I threw it over the side of my deck?
Probably, right?
Do it.
Nah, I'm just kidding around.
Here you go, Mom.
Oh, no! My hands are so slippery!
Oh, no! Oh, oh, oh!
Nice arm.
You goddamn piece of shit idiot asshole.
This is what you do.
This is what you always do.
This is why Mom loves Doll more than you.
She's right. Doll never hurt anybody.
Doll wouldn't throw you
over the side of a mountain.
Gotta make things right.
Gotta get Doll back.
Okay, one drink. And then, Doll back.
You screw-up.
You're making your daughter hate you.
Which is good, because look what happens
when people love you.
Look at Penny. And Herb. And Sarah Lynn.
It's because you made them love you,
BoJack.
You gotta fix this, dummy.
How can you fix this?
Princess Carolyn?
She hates your guts.
Todd? No.
Diane? Yes! Oh, good.
Good old responsible Diane,
she'll know what to do.
Oh... aah...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh.
"California can't wait."
Am I Ace of Base right now?
Because all that I want
is another one of these babies.
BoJack Horseman?
What is this, a will.i.am-style
celebrity endorsement video?

BOJACK: Where's Diane?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, she's on the roof.
Boy, will she be surprised
to see you. Diane!

BOJACK: What are you doing?
No, not like this.
She doesn't know I'm here.
First time she sees me
can't be drunk asking for help.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What's wrong? You need help?

BOJACK: Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
You gotta get me outta here.
Where did I park?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Um...

BOJACK: Beep. Beep, beep?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You shouldn't be driving right now.
Why don't I make like Eddie Money
and take you home tonight?

BOJACK: No, I can't go home. Not without Doll.
Also, Eddie Money doesn't do
the taking home in "Take Me Home Tonight,"
so if you're taking me home,
then I would be Eddie Money.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay, something's going on with you.
It's not like you to be so testy.

BOJACK: Yes, it is.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Everyone, take the rest of the day off.
My pal BoJack needs a friend day.
California can wait!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Elton, you have to play this wedding.
You're gonna do a duet
with a hologram of Nat King Cole.
Or, if that's cost-prohibitive,
Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes.
Great.
We are killing this.
You cannot just walk into a room and say,
"I have terrible news about Meryl Streep."
We're toast.
Hmm... what if we put together
a project so enticing
she couldn't help but climb aboard?
One more gig...
But what could we possibly offer her
that she hasn't already done?
Direct.
Yeah.
But the dream of any director
is to work with Meryl Streep.
You think Meryl wants to direct
a bunch of actors who aren't Meryl Streep?
Okay, all right. Okay, fine.
Let's take this to the Streep.

BOJACK: Welcome...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, hey!

BOJACK: ...to the nightmare, non-sexy version of
Three's Company  that my life has become.
For your information, we are on the case.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Just need a whiff of your mom
to track the scent.
Uh, excuse me, young lady,
I'm looking for a Beatrice,
but you're way too young and attractive
to be that mean old crone.

BOJACK: What are you doing?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay, I'm picking up
on some fruity overtones.
Oak, desert sage... 
No, I'm just kidding around.
It's smelling humor.

BOJACK: Is this the best time
to be workshopping your tight five?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay, got it.
Ooh, this way?
No! No, no. That way!
Out the door! Come on! Here we go!

BOJACK: Look at him. Not a care
in the world. How does he do it?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: This is the place.

BOJACK: Oh, hi, I'm--
Felicity Huffman?
Yes!
Yes.

DIANE: Yeah, but it kind of works.
I'm sorry,
I feel like we always talk about me.
What's going on with you, Roxie?

TODD: Okay.
Hey, Diane, can I get your advice
on something?

DIANE: Yeah, of course. I'm not doing anything.

TODD: So, I have this friend,
and his name
is Darnarius McQuimberton.

DIANE: Oh, yeah,
I think I read an article about him
in Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.

TODD: Darnarius is supposed to get married
this weekend.
And it's going to be an amazing wedding,
but it's kind of based on a lie.
Should he go through with it?

DIANE: Well, all weddings are lies, right?
Sort of.
You're making this big declaration
about how you're gonna stay
with this person forever,
but you don't actually know that.
You're just saying it.
The whole thing is a farce.

TODD: Yeah, that's true.

DIANE: But it's a lie based on truth.
Like, at the center of the farce
there's this nugget
of something real and pure.
And that strange beautiful something
is why you put up
with everything else, right?

TODD: I guess so.

DUANE: And sometimes it's hard to remember
that pure, shining thing
because it's been painted over
with so many arguments
and compromises and disappointments.
But you have to believe
it's still down there somewhere,
even if you can't see it.
And maybe even the belief in it
is more important than the thing itself,
but only as long as you still believe it.
Does that make sense?

TODD: Yeah. Thanks, Diane.
You've given me
and Darquimbertus McNarington
a lot to think about.

DIANE: That was good advice.
I'm, like, a really good friend.

BOJACK: Okay.
So that doll actually belongs to my mom.
She's very sick, very frail.
And I know you're really mad at me
because...
Think, shit-for-brains, think.
Why is Felicity Huffman mad at you?
You cut her off in traffic,
got her fired off a project,
talked shit about her at an AIDS benefit
and didn't realize your mic was on.
Oh.
I assume your maid
or gardener or something?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Citizens, citizens.
As the future governor of California,
I pride myself on probably being able
to reach compromises
across the ideological spectrum.
Oh! What if we cut the baby in half?

BOJACK: What?
No.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So you both agree that's a bad idea.
Perhaps you're not so different after all?
Advantage: Peanutbutter.

BOJACK: How is that...?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Felicity Huffman, you are a beloved star
of film and television.
BoJack, you have also
appeared in film and television.
What's that like? Discuss.

BOJACK: I'm sorry for my acquaintance.
I'm actually a big fan.
God I hope
she has no follow-up questions.
What?
Yup, love it.
Ugh, TV? No.
I just got out of that sinkhole.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: He'll do it, if you give us our doll back.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What's your status, private?
And the offer?
Yeah, I know what
"packaging talent" means.
All right! Yes!

BOJACK: What if I kill myself by throwing myself
off my deck
into Felicity Huffman's backyard.
If she found my dead body,
that'd show her.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Why are we at a bar?

BOJACK: We're just celebrating getting Doll back.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You don't want to bring the doll back
to your mom?

BOJACK: I will. We're just having a drink first.
Relax.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay.

BOJACK: He knows you're terrible.
He's the biggest idiot in the world,
even he knows you're terrible.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So when did you get a daughter?
She's new, right?
Or was she always part of the gang?

BOJACK: I met her about a month ago.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Whoa!

BOJACK: Yeah. And it was great, at first.
But now I can feel her getting attached,
and I just know
I'm gonna BoJack things up.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: "BoJack things up?"
You mean, show up somewhere
and be the life of the party?
Then share a laugh
with your good friend, Mr. Peanutbutter?

BOJACK: No, obviously I meant screw everything up
until she hates me.
I don't think I can take that.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Maybe this time, don't do the thing
that makes her hate you.

BOJACK: I don't want to,
but every time she looks at me
with those big innocent eyes,
all I can think about
is every shitty thing I've ever done,
and I think,
"I don't deserve that kind of love."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Look, BoJack, I don't know a lot
about balancing a state budget
or how a bill becomes a law.

BOJACK: Uh...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't know a lot about a lot of things.
But I do know this:
everybody deserves to be loved.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Rutabaga...
Todd! Have you finished
your groomsmen list?
We gotta figure out
how many parachutes we need.

TODD: Uh, guys, I-- I can't marry Courtney.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

TODD: I've been doing some thinking,
and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.
The lollipop part is a lie,
but at the center of the lie
there's a truth.
That's the Tootsie Roll,
and that's why people get married.
But if I married Courtney
it would be a lie without any truth in it,
like a Tootsie Pop
with just the lollipop part
and nothing in the middle.
I guess it's a bad analogy.
But I don't want a fake marriage.
I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, Todd.
You gotta do what's right for you.

TODD: Thanks, Princess Carolyn.
Whoa--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: All right, blue sky time. Wedding's off.
Can we spin this somehow?
Courtney got jilted,
play the sympathy card?
That's your solution?
What happened to the guy
from this morning with all the big ideas?
Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed,
read them some script coverage
of the film adaptation of  Good Night Moon
and then come back?
This is important.
Fine, both things are equally important.
What kind of ways?
He's a jerk, right? It's not just me?
You don't think I'm like that?
You're not just saying that?
Good night, Judah.

BOJACK: Okay. You're welcome.
Go talk to her, idiot.
Drink first. No, you stupid alcoholic.
Talk to your daughter. You're ruining her.
You know that, right?
No matter what,
your poison is already in her.
There's nothing you can do.
That's not true.
Yeah, it is, you stupid piece of shit.
You're a real stupid piece of shit,
and everywhere you go you destroy people.
Your mother never loved you.
That's why Sarah Lynn died,
Charlotte'll never forgive you.
What you gonna do to Hollyhock?
What you gonna do, asshole? Shut up!
Got Doll back. No big deal.
Just drive around.
Sometimes I go to a bar.
Sometimes I pull over
by the side of the road,
just sit there for hours.
Hollyhock...
No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.
If I'm shitty,
that's just because I'm shitty.
And you're allowed to be mad at me,
but you need to know that whatever I do,
it's not your fault.
I know what you mean.
Yeah?
Yeah.
