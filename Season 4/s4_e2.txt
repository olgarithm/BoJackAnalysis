BOJACK: I don't need any help, thanks.
Ryan Gosling? No.
I get that all the time, it's--
No, sorry.
Okay I'm not too fat to be BoJack.
No, BoJack is not fatter.
No! We are both equally not fat.
Are you kidding me?
He looks nothing like me...
Meester Horseman.
No.
I'm not 
Listen to me--
All right! Ow!
No!
What?!
Why would you get Paul Giamatti
to play me... meaty roles like that one?
What do you care?
What kind of a sandwich
has cherries on top?
Ow!
Hey, what's your name?
Eddie, why don't you mind
your goddamn business?
What? Wait.
Hey, did you fix my door?
That is a dick move, buddy!
What the...?
Hey! Stop fixing my door, asshole!
Why did you fix this so good?
Well, call me a Kit Kat bar
because I'm already broken.
I plastered this wall, didn't I?
Uh... oh... oh, oh...
The problem is
I can't get the right supplies
because the girls at the hardware store
are so annoying.
Yeah. "Hey, Tamara, how about
you get some manners ta-day?"
Yeah, fine, you can help, a little.
If it means so much to you,
I will let you help me.
Oh.
How come you don't go away
for winter like everyone else?
Okay.
So, like, in an airplane, then?
You don't have to fly the plane.
They got this new thing now,
it's called being a passenger.
BoJack Horseman? No.
Who's BoJack Horseman?
He's a very famous TV and film star.
Or he was, yeah, before he gave it all up
for a life of quiet anonymity.
Where is he? Nobody knows.
Perhaps a small town just like this one.
Perhaps he's even...
in this very room.
But he's not,
'cause I'm not BoJack Horseman.
He was my grandfather. I used to come here
in the summers when I was a kid.
Yeah, well, there isn't any more of us.
I'm the last of my line.
Once my mother dies and I die
that'll be it,
which is probably for the best.
Oh, thank you.
That was the reaction I was going for.
Why'd you call me Hambone?
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
Huh.
Look at this.
What? No. Why would I--?
Forget that.
Look at that weather vane.
The house isn't finished yet.
We can't stop
till we find that weather vane.
Oh. Uh, all right.
Oh.
Hey, there it is!
Why'd you say you can't fly? Who's that
other person you're clearly in love with?
Fine. Keep your stupid secret
about your clearly dead wife
and your probably-related
dumb fear of flying. See if I care.
Ooh! It's still there!
Oh, of course, the twelve hundred...
pound horse
will shimmy up a drain pipe to get it,
that makes more sense
than the dragonfly, who has the word "fly"
in the name of what he is.
Okay, all right, so you've gone now.
You walked away, while I make my point.
Idiot.
Huh.
Hey, Eddie, come on. Eddie, let's go!
Eddie, let's go!
Yeah? Well, you got a nice set of pipes.
You're like a Josh Groban
who doesn't also think he's funny.
Wow.
I wish I could somehow
pay you back for all your help.
Hey, Eddie.
Ow! 
I don't know, I thought
you would fly to save me
and by making you fly I would,
in a sense, be saving you!
You're flying right now, asshole!
You're welcome.
Okay. Obviously, this was not
the preferred outcome for either of us.
Oh, shit. No, I'm fine, actually.
Clearly, this is a sore subject. I was
wrong to bring it up. Let's go back down.
Whoa! Plane! Look out!
Oh, God. No, no, come on.
Come on.
Are you insane?!

DIANE: BoJack? Where are you?
Are you okay?

BOJACK: I don't know. I'm so sorry.

DIANE: It's okay. Talk to me.
What's going on?

BOJACK: It's Michigan,
and it's beautiful here,
and everything sucks.

DIANE: Michigan?
BoJack, come home.

BOJACK: I can't.
I don't belong there,
I don't belong anywhere.

DIANE: But that's the thing,
everybody belongs in Los Angeles.
There's, like, no barrier for entry.

BOJACK: Oh, God, that's true. 
They do let in just anybody.

DIANE: I was at a coffee shop yesterday,
I heard a guy trying to impress someone
by soft-pitching a web series
he crowdfunded.

BOJACK: Let me guess: the web series is about
how funny he and his friends are,
just, like, hanging out.

DIANE: He described it as HBO's  Girls
but, like, from a guy's perspective.

BOJACK: What?!
And he's just giving this away for free
in a coffee shop?
Somebody get this guy an overall!

DIANE: Well, the important thing
is that barista's
definitely going to have sex
with him later.

BOJACK: I've missed you, Diane.

DIANE: I've missed you, too.

BOJACK: Keep going, keep going, keep going.
There we go, big boy.
Oh hey probably should have warned you,
when these guys tear the house down
it might make some noise.
Uh, yeah. You think I just want
to mope around in a shrine to the past,
getting off on my own guilt
while the rest of my life passes me by?
Pathetic, much?
Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.
That's usually a series wrap
on a friendship.
Are you serious?
Oh, my God, what am I doing
in this backwash of a town?
Do you even get Showtime here?
I don't know.
Guess it was just a big waste of time.
But you can't change the past.
Time's arrow marches on, right?
Well, as a great woman once said,
suck a dick, dumbshit.
Home.
