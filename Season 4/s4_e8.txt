BOJACK: Yeah.
You know what is fun? You coming with me
to my first day on my new show.
"BoJack Horseman
in  F.H.B.A. Los Angeles,
starring BoJack Horseman
as 'the Judge.'"
I think it's one of those shows
about Navy sex crimes that have gone cold?
And there may be numbers or something?
Then, they call "the Judge."
Totally. Look at this guy,
texting in the middle of the intersection.
You have been judged
to be a shitty driver.
I'm the Judge.
I sentence you to kiss my ass.
Boom!
You got "judged."
It feels good
to be a dramatic actor again.
To make someone laugh
is a craft, to be sure,
but to make someone cry, on purpose,
that is a precious gift.
Actually, that's so his job of him.
Hey, PA, whose name I already forgot.
Still not interested. Can you take
my daughter to "video village"?
I wanna make sure she sees me
at my most awesome,
which is with a slightly high angle
to avoid appearance of a double chin.
Note to director.
Um... what's all this then?
No, I'm good.
Remind me what this show is?
I mean I know, remind me?
So are we judging who has the best booty?
So if it's not about their butts,
then why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-Lot?
Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing.
Well, I gotta shoot
for, like, ten more hours.
Apparently, it takes three hours to set up
the "badonka-donka-dobstacle course."
Shouldn't you be
"Sir Minding-Your-Own-Business-A-Lot"?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Because it's the holiest of all cheeses?
Thanks.
I'm sure I'm going to love them.
And they're gonna love me.
I'm Princess Carolyn!
Of course. But what about her?
Whoa.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Katrina!
Just the person I wanted to talk to!
Marvelous!
Room service, tiny ketchup bottles,
handy list of cable channels.
Now I know why so many people
like being homeless.

DIANE: Mr. Peanutbutter, that's not--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: On the phone, darling.
Nothing comes to mind.
I'm dropping out of the race.
Woodchuck's a better leader
than I'll ever be.
What is it about then?
Well, hopefully those evil lobbyists
can find some other puppet
to do their bidding.

DIANE: Why would you hope that?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm done running for governor,
so you're fired.
No hard feelings, right?

DIANE: Bye, Cruella!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Nice to meet you.
Hello.
It's so wonderful to meet you all!
Oh. No, thank you.
That's all right.
I shouldn't.
No.
Not tonight.
I don't smoke.
No, I don't want to.
I so appreciate that,
and I hate to be rude,
but I really don't think it's a good idea.
Oh, I know.
I grew up around rich people.
But I'm actually good,
as far as belly-punchings go.
Oh.
Okay, look, the truth is--
Yes!
Wow, golf. Fore! Am I right?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Californians, this is an endorsement!
My message is simple.
If you want to vote Peanutbutter,
vote Coodchuck-Berkowitz
because a vote for Coodchuck-Berkowitz
is a vote for Peanutbutter.
Since Peanutbutter
likes Coodchuck-Berkowitz.
So if you like Coodchuck-Berkowitz,
vote like Mr. Peanutbutter...
...for Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.
Yes.
By voting for Woodchuck.
They sure made a monkey out of you, huh?
I feel that went pretty well.
You were gonna say "hands," weren't you?
So, what's next for us two amigos?
Wha-wha-wha-what?
So this chapter of my life is over?
Doggy, doggy. What now?

BOJACK: Hey, Mom.
You got something in the mail.
You know what? I'll check.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, where have you been?
Hold up.
Did you and that PA hook up last night?
Oh, boy. Okay. Sit down.
Hollyhock, you are never gonna hear
from that guy again.
Oh, wow, I didn't realize.
Should we plan the wedding for you
and teenage-boy-you-slept-with
who-said-he-would-definitely-text-you"?
Believe me, I take no pleasure
in telling you this,
but that kid is never, ever, ever--
Hollyhock, it is very rude to interrupt.
Now, where was I?
Right. You'll never  ever
hear from this guy again.
Ba-ba-ba!
In fact, if he texts you,
I will do a hundred pushups.
That's how sure I am,
since there is no possible way--
Not inside enough.
I figured it out and it's dumb.
Nope, can't. Impossible.
Anyone who says
they did a pushup is lying.
Oh. Well, you wanna
have breakfast first?
I got a box of crullers,
of which one remains.
Okay.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We have gathered in Todd's new apartment
to discuss the future of PB Livin'.
That was a pretense
to get you to show up.
It was Todd's idea.
What else you got, Todd?

TODD: Well, I got this one thing.
I don't know. It might be pretty dumb.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You bite your tongue.
Well, in that case, I guess I must have
"terrible" business instincts.
Because I wanna hear it.
They say "the devil's in the details,"
so let's summon the devil!

TODD: Okay, so you know how hard it is
to get your kids to go to the dentist?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't.

TODD: But what if dentists
had a friendlier face?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ooh!

TODD: What if you could take your kids
to a dentist's office
where all the dentists were clowns?
Kids love clowns!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Do kids love clowns?

TODD: Don't they?
Who else would clowns be for?
Because adults don't love clowns.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That is true.
Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.

TODD: So kids must love clowns,
because otherwise,
why would there be clowns?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That is sound logic. Okay.
I want these clown dentists
laughing maniacally
as they drill into the teeth
of America's children, starting yesterday!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Are they? Hm.
That would have been helpful information
before I committed.
But my word is my bond
and I already said yes, didn't I?
Okay, so do we find dentists
and train them to be clowns,
or do we get clowns
and train them to be dentists?

TODD: Why don't we get clowns and dentists
and they can train each other?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, somebody call the police department,
because you are  on fire!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's been so wonderful getting
to know you all these last few days.
Cat ears?
Okay, that's actually a stereotype.
Cats do take baths.
I really wish you'd told me
your family's holiday was so anti-cat.

BOJACK: Hello, Hollyhock.
Oh, come on. Wait there.
There's a spare bulb in the kitchen.
I've been sitting in that chair
for five hours waiting to do this.
Agh, damn it! Son-of-a--! What?
Hello, Hollyhock.
I'm trying to keep you out of trouble
with a showman's flair for the dramatic.
You don't tell me when
you're home late.
This is my house.
You need to ask permission.
I'm just looking out for you.
You spent the last four days
with this kid, I'm worried--
Yeah, now. But come on, Hollyhock.
He's a teenage boy
whose job is to be around hot women
in skimpy outfits all day.
You think he's gonna want--
No, I just mean that...
Well, you're the one
who said you were a blob.
No.
You said "blob."
I just-- 
I just think L.A. is a superficial town
and you need to be careful.
Hollyhock, wait. Wait. Wait!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Why didn't you tell me they hate cats?
Now I get why you didn't want
to tell your family about the baby.
And what are me and Philbert?

BOJACK: Can't believe she's still pissed at me.

DIANE: You shouldn't have called her a "blob."

BOJACK: I'm a blob too! We're both blobs!

DIANE: How about just as a general rule,
don't ever call a woman a blob?

BOJACK: Never! What if I meet a woman
whose name is Barbara Lob?
And I call her "B" for short. "B. Lob."

DIANE: Maybe instead of figuring out
the woman blob workaround,
you should just tell Hollyhock
you're sorry.

BOJACK: I still think Miles is up to something.

DIANE: Why is it so hard for you to believe
someone could genuinely
like your daughter?

BOJACK: Because she's like me!

DIANE: Okay. Do you think maybe this could be
more about you than it is about her?

BOJACK: Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work
to do on myself. Everyone knows that.
But the important thing right now
is how I can fix things with Hollyhock.
Try to stay on topic, Diane.

DIANE: Well, an open conversation
about your concerns with--

BOJACK: No, that's too Diane-y.
She'd never buy it was coming from me.

DIANE: Then why do you want my advice?

BOJACK: I got it. If I can somehow prove to her
what a jerk Miles is,
then she'll have to like me more
by default.
That's the BoJack way.

DIANE: BoJack, no--!
Oh-- oh...
Ooh, that's... that's nice.

BOJACK: Goldie, how would you like
to advance to the final round?
You had sex with him?
I just said "seduce" the PA.
No, I just wanted you to,
like, get him all hot and bothered.
And ready to sleep with you.
Then once you get him on audiotape
saying that he would sleep with you...
...come up with some excuse to get
out of there with virtue intact.
Okay, well, the important thing is,
we got him now.
Tell Miles what you told me.
What? Not him?
Not sleep with.
I said "seduce." There is a distinction.
This was all a big misunderstanding.
So it is about judging booties.
Miles.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean?
Oh, wow.

DIANE: So you were right. He was a dirtbag.

BOJACK: Yeah. I was kinda hoping
I was wrong for once.

DIANE: If it makes you feel any better,
you were wrong
about all the other parts of this.

BOJACK: Diane, you are so bad
at making people feel better.

DIANE: Are you gonna tell Hollyhock?

BOJACK: She's a smart girl.
She'll figure it out eventually.
But for now, if she believes someone
can love her for who she really is,
then why would I take that
away from her?

DIANE: BoJack, you gotta get
one of these massages.
Oh-hh!

BOJACK: Okay.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Thank you for hosting us.
It was so nice to get away for the week
and learn all about
your charming little traditions
that didn't freak me out at all. Bye-bye!

DIANE: Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter, I am so relaxed.
I didn't realize
how much tension I'd built up in my--
Oh, my God! Um...
Mr. Peanutbutter, why is our hotel room
filled with dentist clowns?

TODD: Don't be ridiculous, Diane.
They're not all dentist clowns.
Half of them are clown dentists.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER:Just try to ignore them
and go about your business.

DIANE: Okay.
Ugh!
"UnbeataBiel"?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER:What the--?!

DIANE: Oh-hh! Katrina.

TODD: Not now, Professor Flim-Flam!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER:Of course,
Katrina would latch onto Jessica
as the beautiful face
of her dangerous agenda.

TODD: Well, there's no way
they could beat Woodchuck, right?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER:No? Because I almost beat him
and I don't even know
what a governor does.

DIANE: That's true.
Mr. Peanutbutter, you've got to help.
Woodchuck has no idea
what he's up against.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER:You're right! But are we sure
this is the right thing for us?
If I jump right back into politics,
that's not gonna give me a lot of time
to focus on our burgeoning
clown dentistry business.

DIANE: Then it is definitely
the right thing for us.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ha! Woodchuck!
You need me, Woodchuck!
You've got brain smarts,
but your sober-minded policy speeches
are no match for the glitz and pizzazz
of a Hollywoo starlet.
Even a relatively low-wattage one
like Jessica Biel.
I was married to both Jessica and Katrina.
I know them inside and out.
And I'm not speaking in a sexual way,
although it is also true in a sexual way.
You gotta let me join the campaign!
Great! There's no time to lose.
Quick! Get in Dr. Boing-Boing's
dream-powered smile-mobile!

BOJACK: Hey.
I'm sorry I was an asshole.
What are you doing?
No.
I was just jealous because you were
spending a lot of time with him.
Forget him. You're gonna meet lots of guys
who will fall madly in love with you.
Hollyhock, you are an amazing woman
and you should never settle for someone
who only loves the idea of you.
You are funny, and you're kind,
and you're clever.
I-- come on.
What do you want me to say?
Obviously, I think you're beautiful.
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't we go get some Cold Stone?
That'll take your mind off Miles.
Plus, I'll let you drive the Tesla!
Well, then, forget that.
Let's get a pizza.
Oh.
