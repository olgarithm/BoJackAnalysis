BOJACK: Well let me be the first to tell you:
I'm bad news.
I can't offer you parental guidance
or advice or love or support
or prolonged conversation
or interest in you,
or remembering your name.
Great.
Your mother? What do I look like,
Josh Radnor?
Nothing? Nothing for Josh Radnor.
How quickly we forget.
That was quite a time
for our nation, sex-wise...
The point is I banged a lot of women.
One-night stands, two-night stands,
nooners, spooners, hot-air ballooners.
I guess Marcy was kind of
a poking holes in the condom type.
Real nutter. Good lay, though.
I bet she's still in that same apartment
in the Valley. What a dump!
Deal. But can we go in the morning?
It's getting pretty late,
I become a real asshole
if I don't get a solid seven hours
of bed drinking a night.
Wait.
Take this.
Yes, everyone hopes that all the time.
Ugh! What now?
I gotta call all eight? They can't
work out a phone tree? 
If you're gonna be a baby,
stay here for the night.
Take the couch and be quiet.
Don't get on your phone and text
all your friends how sweet my house is.
Turn off all the lights when you're
going to sleep, all of the lights.
Thank you, BoJack.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, I can't--

DIANE: Oh, you're-- you're in my--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wait, I'm not really--

DIANE: What if we try...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wait, I'm almost... Oh, no.

DIANE: I don't think it's going to happen.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm sorry,
it's just difficult with all the--

DIANE: Right.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The campaign.

DIANE: Exactly.
But it's just another two months, right?
After the election
everything goes back to normal.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, unless I win.

DIANE: Right.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I gotta tell you, I'm having a blast.
I always knew I was probably
good at something,
but I never knew what it was.
Thanks to Katrina, I've finally realized
I'm good at people liking me.

DIANE: That's great, and you know
I'm so happy for you,
but do you have to be
the pro-fracking candidate?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, this is the campaign.
Nothing anyone says
during a campaign matters.
It's just promising a bunch of stuff
to get people to vote for you.
Then when you get an office,
you can do whatever you want.

DIANE: Democracy in action.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Mark my words--
the only fracking
that's going to be happening
is in this bedroom.

DIANE: All right, guy.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm gonna drill you deep,
and fill you with a mysterious substance
that scientists still don't quite
understand the ramifications of.

DIANE: This isn't sexy for me-- aaah!
No one said "busy day," Katrina.
What did we say about knocking?
No one else was talking.

TODD: Damn!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow! Am I John Davidson,
Cathy Lee Crosby
and Fran Tarkenton right now,
because that's--
Yeah! Breakfast!
Am I Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald,
Judd Nelson, the principal...
All right!
Don't you forget about me.

DIANE: We were kind of in the middle of--

BOJACK: What the...? Huh?
What's going on down here?
Did you take the foil off?
It's all right, it's not your fault.
Making food is impossible.
Let's get out of here
and take you to your mom's house.
Just leave it.
It'll tire itself out eventually.
It's actually a cute story.
She was the president of my fan club.
Yeah. "Oh, my God, what a monster!"
I slept with someone who loved me
more than anybody else
and dedicated her life to knowing things
about me and caring about me.
How could I be so shallow?
That was the whole story.
She was the president of my fan club,
I had sex with her.
Then I didn't think about her
for 18 years, and here we are.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh!
How many do I have left?
Doctor, no!
"iOvulate"?

BOJACK: Marcy, hey.
Right. Um...
here's a very specific question:
after we had sex,
did you by any chance get pregnant
and put a baby up for adoption?
Wait, really?
Wow.
Wha...? That's so weird.
You must have dialed it wrong.
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna,
but then, you know, 9/11 happened...
And that was just such
a tough time for our country...

DIANE: So the article is just about
a happy marriage with a healthy sex life?
We already have Raquel's piece
about 69 days of sixty-nining.
What about our readers
who aren't having sex with their husbands?
Isn't this just gonna make them feel bad?
Not everyone gets to have
great sex all the time, right?
Ladies?
I don't have an office.
You said offices have corners
and corners are the patriarchy.
Whoa, Stefani, that's not--
Diane, relax! This is not a conversation
between an employee and her superior.
The campaign
has been testing our marriage.
Obviously, it's great to see
Mr. Peanutbutter so excited,
and I am supporting that.
But if I'm being honest,
I can't wait for it to be over
so things can go back to normal.
He's not going to win.
People wouldn't love saying it
if they understood what it actually was.
I can't go against my husband.

BOJACK: Yes.
That actually might have
Kids. What?
What?! No!
Uh... Hollyhock?
Marcy? No way!
Why would they release a romantic drama
called  Autumn in New York
in the middle of summer?
How do you know all this?
This is a summer dress?
I guess I don't know dresses.
So the lesson here is
I was right to never call her.
Wait, so who--
Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time!
Give me a few minutes. I'll distract her,
then you sneak in and grab the book.
Okay.
And what was the first appearance
of the Horse's identical cousin?
Yeah, yeah. That's right.
What was the horse's boss's name?
Oh, my God!
You're not supposed to see this.
Look away!
I didn't think it would take this long.
I usually finish faster.
That's what I needed.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So the studio finished Mars Attacks!
without him.
And since no one ever found a body,
my client Tony Tromboni
has been making movies
under the name Tim Burton ever since.
Oh, fish! We gotta go.
You heard the bracelet.
There's no time for that! Ralph!
I have an egg inside me
that is ripe to be fertilized.
His name is Philbert.
Uh-uh! Philbert Stilton,
and he's going to be sweet and smart
and a phenom on the clarinet,
and one day you'll be driving him home
from band practice
and he's going to all of a sudden
say something so insightful and true
that you'll be positively floored
it came out of the mouth of your son.
But if you don't take me home right now
and impregnate me,
then Philbert will never exist.

BOJACK: You told me to distract her.
So now that we got the list,
we gotta go see all these other women?
Not all of them,
just the ones you didn't see
in the nine months
after you had sex with them.
That's gonna be most of them.
I never understood that show.
What's a Timedium?
That's so stupid.
She time-travels and she's a medium?
I can make this real quick.
Did you give up my secret baby
in the year 2000?
Oh my god is every one of these
gonna be a whole thing?
Nice. You don't want
any little BoJacks floating around.
Last thing this world needs
is more of this garbage.
No, you're great, you seem cool,
but if we could go back in time
and prevent it...
Right?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Go, go! Oh, God!
No, no, no.
Hit the gas! Do it for Philbert!
Oh, fish!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So in conclusion, I don't think California
is the greatest state in the country.
But it can be.
Drill away.
Diane wrote that?

TODD: Damn.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I would.
Uh--
Oh...
Ready when you are, boys!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Look just write us a ticket and let us go.
We don't have time for this! I'm in heat!
Don't tell me to calm down
or call me ma'am!
Just write us a goddamn ticket
so I can go home and mount my boyfriend!

BOJACK: Obviously, I didn't mean you.
You're just gonna keep giving me the silent treatment?
Well, who else is on this list?
Stacy, Fabiana... Tonya Harding?
She is not gonna be happy to see me.
She said sleeping with me
is the worst thing she ever did.
I don't understand
why we're even doing this.
You're never gonna switch bodies
with your mom.
That ship has sailed
and is also impossible.
No.
Jesus. Fine.
No. Hollyhock.
Joke's on you, I already have one!

DIANE: Oh no. No. No, no.
Where's Mr. Peanutbutter?
Aaah! How could you let him do this?
I didn't "call his bluff." I just--
I am being supportive.
It's called Girl Croosh.
And my piece wasn't about
Mr. Peanutbutter, specifically.

TODD: Damn!

DIANE: We're not.

TODD: Damn!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Huh.
Your lawyer, he's good?
Then you know what we have to do?
For Philbert?
Sorry you have to be here for this.

BOJACK: Alone, at last. Thank God.
Fine, fine, fine.
Hi, Fabiana. Before you slam the door--
Did a young horse girl come by here,
about yay high?
You're still mad about your dad's funeral?
That was 18 years ago!
Thank you, Tonya.
I know we've had our differences,
but seeing you always leaves me
weak in the knees.
Hollyhock.
Was that her?
How did you find me?
I went to everyone on that list.
Really haven't aged well, I know.
Oh, yeah, that too.
But I needed to find you.
To tell you I'm sorry,
for being such an asshole
then and also now.
This whole thing was stupid.
I never should have come out here.
Hollyhock, it's okay to want a mom.
I know I just met you,
but if you do have
any of the old Horseman gunk
bouncing around in that brain of yours,
I gotta tell you right now
you should give up on looking for "enough"
because it will never be enough.
Eww!
Stop that.
There, there.
What do your dads say when you cry?
Well, that-- that's good advice, right?
Oh. You don't have to leave right away.
Why don't you just
stay with me a bit longer?
At least until we find your mom.
Oh...
Yeah. But what if I told you
there's a name that isn't on that list?
Someone Marcy never knew about.
I don't know. But you can stay with me
while we try to find her?
Her name was Brown Car... la.
Carla Mercedes Benz... Brown.
You've got a weird name.
Mm-hmm?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, I know. I'm sorry about the trucks,
but you didn't give me much choice.
I know these last few days
have been crazy.
But this is the hard part.

DIANE: I need you to drop out of the race.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What?

DIANE: Please, Mr. Peanutbutter.
This isn't worth it.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I hear what you're saying
and I will try to be more conscientious
of your needs.

DIANE: Drop out of the race.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Because your needs are important.

DIANE: I've written another piece
for Girl Croosh.
It's called
"The Case Against Mr. Peanutbutter."
When I hit this button,
the post goes live.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, don't.

DIANE: I don't want to.
And I won't, if you drop out of the race.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Jesus, Diane. You can't do that.

DIANE: Because you're the only one allowed
to make decisions for this family?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No. Because it's gonna come off
as a weird lovers' spat
and it's just going to embarrass everyone.

DIANE: Well, I'm sorry if I embarrass you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, come on.

DIANE: You told me this morning you weren't going to frack,
and now I can't
turn on a faucet in my own home
without getting third-degree burns.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, I get it. So like always,
you're mad at someone,
so your solution is to air
your dirty laundry for everyone to see.

DIANE: No. This is not about us.
I don't want you to be governor
because you would be bad at it,
because you don't stand for anything.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No!
Hey!
Don't you dare.
Robert Blake gave me that mug.
No! Oh, you...
I don't...

DIANE: Shut up. Take off your shirt.
Frack me, Mr. Peanutbutter!
Frack me!
