MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's fine, Katrina. If I didn't randomly
wander into doors all the time,
I never would have ended up
co-piloting the very plane
that brought me to Los Angeles.
Of course. That's why I stopped...
what I was doing to come inside.
Ooh, are you filming a sitcom?
I love sitcoms!
You should have a character say,
"Talk to the hand."
The hand! Not the face,
where the ears are.
Newsflash: hands can't hear.
But my favorite scenes
are when a character
is completely oblivious to something
really important going on behind him.
That, dear friends, is where the sit
truly hits the com.
Kind of in the middle of something.
He's yakking away, tension's building...
...the audience is like,
"Hey, turn around."
Maybe the person behind him
even interrupts him--
Yeah just like that.
And then, when it would be ridiculous
to go on even one second longer...
Do you mind?
Only then does he say,
exasperated,
"What? What do you want?"
Doggie-doggie what now?
Me, a star? But I have
no experience, no formal training.
Ohh...

DIANE: Hey, BoJack, it's me again.
Hmm?
I haven't heard from you
in, like, three months,
so I'm calling again
to make sure you're okay.
What's new with me?
Well...

TODD: Monocle? No, I think
you're thinking of Mr. Peanut.

DIANE: I don't know if you heard
but Mr. Peanutbutter
is running for governor, kind of.
First, they need to get Woodchuck
Coodchuck-Berkowitz recalled,
which is basically impossible.
So that actually makes it really easy
for me to be supportive.
How's the recall effort?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Stupendous!

DIANE: Well even if you don't get all the signatures,
I'll still be proud of you.
Maybe even more so.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: But when we do get
the signatures we need--
please note I said "when," not "if"...

TODD: Noted.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: ...then the campaign will begin in...
oh, where did you say again, Katrina?
Right. Earnest, California.

DIANE: Looks like you two
have everything worked out.
Just please note
that I am being supportive.

TODD: Noted!

DIANE: Most women wouldn't like
having their husband's ex-wife
hanging around all the time,
but I'm totally cool with it
because she makes me look
super chill by comparison.
Oh, uh-- okay.
Anyway, call me back.
This is Diane, by the way.
Nguyen, obviously.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You sure you wouldn't rather
just play a governor
in a movie or TV show?
I could attach Tommy Schlamme
to direct.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Tommy Schlamme, shmommy Schlamme.
This is bigger than all that.
Don't you recall?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Recall what?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: The governor. We need signatures.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, sure.
Where do you stand on the issues?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm mainly for people right now
and also for the future.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Listen, I'm not feeling so hot.
Why don't you go get
signatures downstairs.
Jennifer Garner's in the lobby.
She'll sign on to anything.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: "I always make a beeline
to see my feline." Aww!
Oh, that's right! What train wreck
are we rubbernecking at this year?
Oh! 
Ugh!

TODD: You know what I'd do
if I had eight million dollars?
Oh, no, no, no.
I mean, if I had
eight million dollars now,
I'd start a company that makes
remote-controlled drones.
But these drones have a seat
hanging from the bottom
so you can fly around in it.
A drone with a throne.
A drone throne.
I feel like you're getting
really hung up on labels.
Aww, you don't need an app,
just hang out with me.
What a way to end a sentence.
Whoa. Why did you call me that?
I'm not-- that word doesn't describe--
Wow. Well, I would label
this conversation "rough".

DIANE: Hey, BoJack, it's me again,
voicemail number 17.
Did I tell you I'm working at a blog?
I wrote a story about
an all-girl refugee kickball league.
It didn't get as many clicks as Gillian's
story about how in certain pictures
you can see the outline
of Chris Hemsworth's penis
but, you know, we're all contributing
in our own ways.
Anyway, it's weird not having you around.
I hope you're okay, wherever you are.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: "I'm so smitten
with my favorite little adult cat."
Oh! I love it.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to the  Paul Blart 3: Till Death
Do Us Blart  premiere last night.
I had a doctor's appointment.
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
Oh. Wow!
I-- I could, and I would,
but it's not a good time.
I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah, I'm super young.
Blake Lively accidentally
called me Mommy yesterday,
but I'm sure she does that
to other young women all the time.

TODD: Churro-flavored waffles!
Huh?
Drone Throne.
Whoa, whoa!
Okay, Todd. Whoa!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh, God, today's the day.
I haven't been this nervous
since Diane was vacuuming
during a thunderstorm
on the Fourth of July,
I had to take a bath,
and there was a stranger in our yard.
So it's gonna take a miracle, huh?

DIANE: Oh, no! It's over.
Everyone can get out of my house now.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ooh, tough break, kid.
We're all in shock.
McG! Are you still looking for a star
for your transgender Teddy Roosevelt
Planes, Trains and Automobiles  reboot,
Plans, Trans, A Man, A Canal, Panama?
Because someone just became available.

TODD: Whoa! Whoa!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't understand what happened.

DIANE: I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You know, it's funny.
Personally I like Woodchuck
and he's a fine governor,
but for some reason, even though
I have zero qualifications,
I honestly thought I would have made
an even better governor.

DIANE: Well, what matters is you tried.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: But I would have been good, right?

DIANE: Now that there's no chance
you will ever be governor,
I can tell you honestly...
Yes. You would have been great.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Stop. But seriously, though, elaborate.

DIANE: You care about people,
you follow your heart.
Those are important qualities
you should never give up on.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So what you're saying is
I shouldn't give up?

DIANE: On those qualities.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah. Never concede.
Stick it out, stay in the race.

DIANE: Uh-- no--
Uh, maybe we should get
Katrina's two cents on this.
Katrina?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Race. That's it, Diane!
You diabolical Thin Mint.
You, and only you, are responsible
for the great thing I am about to do.
Katrina?
Thank you, thank you.
Moments ago I found myself
in what seemed to be a no-win situation.
But it turns out
it was a "Nguyen situation."
I'm referring of course
to my supportive wife Diane Nguyen,
who told me to never give up!
And that's why I am challenging
Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz
to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.

DIANE: What?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: No more petitions
or fancy ballot initiatives,
just a mano a mano,
no-holds-barred slippery slalom
down an ice-covered peak.
Winner gets to be governor,
loser goes home.
Your move, Governor.
Mic drop!
Well not just any ski race, a high-stakes dash
down Devil's Mountain
for the governorship itself.
You and me both, friendo.
But this isn't an us-ocracy,
it's a dem-ocracy.
So let's ask "dem" what "dey" think.
Any questions for the governor, folks?

TODD: Drone Throne strikes again! Ha ha!
Suckers! Hooray!
Ha ha! Oh-- oh, no!
Aw, man.
I was hoisted by my own petard,
the one petard I thought
would never hoist me.

DIANE: Well, I guess that puts
that idea to bed, right?
Right?
Right?!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Whoa!

DIANE: This is insane.
You could actually become governor
by winning a race.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah. Wow.
You know, it's days like this
I wish I knew how to ski.
Never really got into it, no.
I didn't think
it would get this far.
You gotta admit, this is pretty out there.

DIANE: Well, I guess that's it. Oh, well.
Tough break. Bye forever, Katrina.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Doggie-doggie what now?

DIANE: Hey, BoJack, it's me again.
Where are you, I'm worried,
hope you're not dead,
etc... you get it.
Anyway, things are even crazier
around here lately.
Don't know if you've seen the news,
but I really wish you were here for this.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Well, I'm off to ski school
so I can learn how to ski,
so I can become the governor.

DIANE: You'd say something like,
"That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard."
Sounds great, sweetheart.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: But as the old saying goes,
that's politics.

DIANE: Then you'd probably say,
"A, that's not an old saying
and, B, that's not politics!
Nothing about that is politics."
This is so great!
Then you would be so overwhelmed
by the unbearable ludicrousness
of the situation
that you would get in your car
and drive to Hawaii,
which is also a thing you could do now
because of a new bill
that cost our state billions of dollars.
It's all so great!
You know, it's funny,
because the last time I saw you
you  told  me  that you needed me
in your life,
and then you just disappeared.
So how do you think
that makes me feel?
Well, wherever you are,
I hope you're happy.
I really do, BoJack.
Also, I haven't seen Todd in a while.
He's not with you, is he?

TODD: Oh, simple kettle corn.
Between the worlds of the sweet
and the savory.
Not quite popcorn, not quite candy.
What are we?
Hey, get away! Get, get!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wow, my first day at ski academy.
What collegiate shenanigans
will befall me?
Professor Thistlethorpe,
the famously humorless yet somehow
also lovable ski instructor?
Uh...
You really mean it?
Oh, I don't have skis.
Was I supposed to bring skis?
You didn't say that.
No! I forgot to.
I'm sor-- Excellent?
Oh!
Are you okay, professor?
I can't believe ski school
is already over.
Professor Thistlethorpe?
Professor Thistlethorpe!
I will.
Also, if you have any tips for skiing,
that would be really helpful.
Who's Ben?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Nothing yet.
Oh! I made you a card.
Sorry, I went a little overboard
with the glitter
and a little underboard with the glue.
No, I was just a little pregnant.
I was gonna tell you, really,
but then before I could tell you
there was nothing to tell you.
I'm sorry. I just felt dumb
because all my life I've wanted a family.
But I didn't want it to happen
just because I got pregnant by accident
and then you got stuck with me.
You know what I mean.
Well, I didn't try to!
Really?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!
Ohh! Get control.

TODD: Goodbye, dear friend.
You served me well.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay, all right, here we go.

TODD: Mr. Peanutbutter?
Ohh! 

DIANE: I see Woodchuck!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh... whoa... Whoa!

DIANE: Oh, my God.

TODD: Todd forever!
Whaa!
Ow, ow, ow, ow! 

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Did I win?

DIANE: Come on, honey.
Let's go home.

TODD: So help me Todd.
You know, ever since
I first became governor
I've thought,
"I don't want to be governor"
and that's where I am now.
So, can I not be governor?
Yeah. I'm just really not
into labels right now.
Maybe after some soul searching
I'll be ready to really know what I am.
But for right now,
I think I speak for all Californians
when I say, "I ate too much kettle corn
while drifting through the sky
on an out of control drone throne."

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Election, you say?
You bet I will, and you know why?
Because this whole ski race was a joke.
Of course Woodchuck was gonna beat me.
He went to Dartmouth.
So where's the candidate
for regular schmoes like me,
who went to Northwestern?
You know, Governor Woodchuck
Coodchuck-Berkowitz
thinks he's better than us,
but is he better than us?
He thinks the race is over.
Well, I say it's just starting.
And he wants me to sit and stay
and roll over?
I say California's tired of rolling over.
What do you say?
I say it's time for me
to stand up and speak.

DIANE: Diane-Diane what now?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So loud as you can,
let me hear what you want.
I can't hear you!

BOJACK:BoJack Horsemack Horseman oh, wait, how do I
