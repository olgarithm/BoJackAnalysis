PRINCESS CAROLYN: I got into
this business because I love stories.
They comfort us, they inspire us,
they create a context
for how we experience the world.
But also, you have to be careful,
because if you spend
a lot of time with stories,
you start to believe that life
is just stories, and it's not.
Life is life, and that's so sad,
because there's so little time and...
what are we doing with it?
Unless you want it to be
a time full of newts.

BOJACK: Wait. I-- I just--
My mother, she's senile,
and she was drugging the coffee.
That's why-- Just--
I wanted you to know that
none of this was Hollyhock's fault.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hmm.
What? Oh, yeah.
BoJack is attached.
But he's not like "attached" attached.
If you want us
to get somebody better--
Well--
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.

DIANE: Look at that!
That is so cool!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Wait, Diane.
Are we in the same house right now?
I don't see you.

DIANE: I can hear you.
I think we're close!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: So I'm invisible?
Oh, in this scenario, am I a ghost?
Of a Union soldier, perhaps,
who cannot rest until
his final letter is delivered!

DIANE: And can I be
Anne of Green Gables?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane, can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

DIANE: Sure!
Why don't you meet me
in the guest bathroom? Ow!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Where's--

DIANE: Hold on. I think--
Here we are.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Diane?
Do you really love this house?

DIANE: Yeah, it's fine.
I didn't love the old house,
but it was your house and I moved in,
and it was great.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: But this is an opportunity
to build something together.
Something that'll last
for the rest of our lives.

DIANE: Anything you want is gonna be good
with me. Just like your old house.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: But I don't want this to just be
another one of  my  houses.
I want this to be our house.

DIANE: And it will be,
because we'll both be living in it.
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I don't need anything fancy.
All that matters to me
is that I get to live with you.
In the real world.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Oh!

DIANE: No more campaign,
no more ex-wives.
Just Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter,
back to normal.
For the rest of our lives.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That sounds great.

DIANE: We'll take it.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: One second, though,
I have to use the bathroom.

BOJACK: How was I supposed to Sha Na know
they were going to invite me
on the stage to do a guitar solo?
Well, too bad
I'm the only dad you got.
O.J. Simpson lawyer
and DNA expert Barry Scheck?
Hi. Yeah, my mom is a resident.
I've still got a bunch of her stuff.
No don't put me on hold.
Just take a message--

TODD: Oh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, buddy.

TODD: Good thinking.
What?
You need to get your shit together.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wha-- Where am I?

TODD: Okay, so you know how you're always
giving pep talks to people,
telling them they need
to get their shit together?
Well, this is me giving you
the Princess Carolyn pep talk.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Why am I tied up in the woods?

TODD: So you can't escape my wise words.
Is that not part of it?
I couldn't remember.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It doesn't matter.
It's all over for me.
When it gets out
I faked BoJack's signature,
the deal's gonna fall apart.
There goes my reputation, my career--

TODD: Well, there's more to life
than just your career, isn't there?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Is there?

TODD: Isn't there?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I have nothing!

TODD: Oh! This pep talk is going
in the wrong direction.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Do you know how hard it is
to start a family at my age?
To find a guy at my age?

TODD: You don't need a guy to start a family.
You're Princess Carolyn.
You can do anything.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, I can't.

TODD: Look, the woods are dark and scary,
but the only way out is through.
I'm sorry.
I got distracted by the woods.
Um, what were we talking about?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, you're right.
The only way out is through.
I gotta talk to BoJack.
I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.
I'm Princess Carolyn.

TODD: That's the spirit!
As my blood type always says,
"B" positive!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What was that?

TODD: I don't know.
Hey, Doctor Picarello.
Doctor Picarello, are you okay?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Todd?

TODD: So it turns out Vice Chancellor
Laughing Gassy got rabies
from quarrelling with an old raccoon.
And then he started biting everyone,
and now a bunch of them have rabies.
Who could have predicted
my innocent clown dentist venture
could turn into something so terrifying?
Yolanda, the only reason
they're in the woods at all
is because of you.
If people find out the Better
Business Bureau is behind this,
you don't think you'll be getting a buzz
from the Business Branch
of the Board of Better Bureaus?
Call me four out of five dentists,
because I agree.

DIANE: Here we are.
The rest of our lives.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, wow.
Do you wanna go to Hawaii?

DIANE: What? Right now?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah! When's the last time
we did something impulsive?

DIANE: Well, you did run for governor
without giving it much--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I just think we could use a vacation.
Things have been so crazy this last year.
Before we start the rest of our lives,
haven't we earned a break?

DIANE: All right. Let's go to Hawaii! They got
that bridge that's just sitting there.
We might as well use it.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right! Hawaii, here we come!

DIANE: All right! Hawaii!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hawaii!

DIANE: Oh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So, listen.
As you know, one of the differences
between agents and managers--

BOJACK: Oh, my God. Stop. Please stop.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm producing a new TV show.
It's a phenomenal script which may
or may not involve ghost or newts.

BOJACK: Does it involve ghost or newts?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It may!

BOJACK: You haven't read it, have you?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Read it? I'm producing it!

BOJACK: Right.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery--

BOJACK: Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Right, well--

BOJACK: They're impossible to figure out.
Then all of a sudden, some random detail
makes the hero remember a conversation
that totally re-contextualizes everything,
and then it all magically comes together.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Sure, but--

BOJACK: It's such bullshit.
Where's my random detail that's gonna
suddenly make everything make sense?
Because I would love that.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Well, this script is really special,
and everyone wants to play the lead,
from Matthew McConaughey
to Matthew Perry.

BOJACK: Matthew Perry?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah. But I was thinking--

BOJACK: Hold on. Matthew Perry...
Why do you ask?
Seems like a long shot. How about
a better strategy is, don't do that,
and then you won't be disappointed
when it doesn't work out?
You mean  Schindler's List .
Remind me?
Whoa.
I have to go.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Look, I'm trying to do you a favor here!

BOJACK: Oh.
Huh.
Huh?

TODD: Yes. Get the magazine.
What a fine addition
to your waiting room.
Oh, no!
Guys, let's talk this out.
Oh, man.
Me neither.
Hmm.

DIANE: Can you not start and stop so much?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I can't control the traffic, darling.
When the car in front of me starts,
I start. And when it stops, I stop.

DIANE: Well maybe you don't have to start
every time the car in front of you starts,
because you know it's gonna
stop again anyway.
You could leave a little space.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay.
And another car just cut in front of me
because I left a little space.

DIANE: Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay. I'm gonna get some gas.
All right. I got the lowdown.
First of all, very important,
I got you this flattened penny.

DIANE: I will cherish it always.
I'm sorry for being annoying before.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Don't worry about it.
Here's the deal.
With this traffic,
we can stay on our current trajectory
and get to Hawaii just in time
to spend two luxurious hours
at the Honolulu Stilton,
and then turn around and come back,
or we can hang out here
at the Thrifty Lodge
at this charming halfway to Hawaii
rest area and gas park.
Excuse me,
we would like your finest room, please.

DIANE: What kind of cuisine is on premises?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And what are your spa hours?

DIANE: Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala,
could I use your grand ballroom for that,
or is that booked months in advance?
I could settle for a demi-ballroom
in a pinch,
but attire will be formal,
I don't wanna upstage the venue.
I see. This will do nicely.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Didn't you tell me once
you always wanted a ballroom?

DIANE: Actually, no. 
What I wanted was a Belle-room.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: What is that? Like a room full of bells?

DIANE: It's a room full of big books,
with big windows and a ladder,
like Belle got in  Beauty and the Beast.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: And it's called a Belle-room?

DIANE: It's called a library.
But I called it a Belle-room
because it was magical.
And since it was a name I made up
for a room that wasn't real,
that meant that it was just mine.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: That's adora-Belle.
What's that?
Ha! That's right.
Hmm?

DIANE: Go, take a picture.
It'll make their day.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You sure? You don't mind?

DIANE: I'll be in the room.
Don't stay out
with your new friends too late.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, guys. I'm coming down.
What other of my things do you like?

DIANE: Okay, so...
Oh.
Hey.

BOJACK: I need to talk to Hollyhock!
You have to let me see her.
Please, I flew all the way here
and it's Wichita,
so it's not like
I got other shit to do in Wichita.
You. You're the one
who likes foreign movies, right?
That part in  Amelie,
where she listens to the guy's story?
This is that part.
And I'm the guy with the story.
And I need you to be Amelie right now.
Okay, you're impossible.
The rest of you, please,
just listen for a second.
I know you hate me.
But for Hollyhock, please, listen.
Whole time she's staying with me,
it doesn't make sense, right?
If I'm her father,
where is her mother?
No, I'm saying, medically,
where is the woman I had sex with
that made her be born?
Right? That's why Hollyhock
came to L.A. in the first place.
But then I thought,
"What if I'm not her father?"
You're her fathers. Yeah. I know, I know.
Eight of you, each have
your own cute thing, I get it.
My point is, Hollyhock and I
have the same DNA,
but that doesn't mean I'm her father.
Oh my god, I feel like you are
willfully misunderstanding me.
What I am saying is,
I'm not even her father biologically.
My father is her father.
I went to every hospital
and clerk house in L.A.
I waited in lines, filled out forms,
talked to anyone who would talk to me.
I wouldn't rest until I knew
I'd done everything I could.
But there was no record
of a little horse girl
born on Hollyhock's birthday...
...in L.A., because Hollyhock
wasn't born in L.A.
She was born in San Francisco.
I got a little bug in my brain
that my father knocked up the help.
So I went up there, and I did
the whole thing again, and I found it.
The birth certificate
with her mother's name,
clear as day, Henrietta Platchkey.
But where is she now, right?
I looked her up on Facebook.
I know what you think:
"BoJack Horseman
has a Facebook account?"
Obviously, I didn't,
because the Internet is for nerds.
But I know it's a good way to find people,
so I set up an account, and I found her.
She lives in Minneapolis.
She's a nurse.
Her phone number
was on her Facebook page.
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.
She has to know.
You don't have to tell her I was here.
I'll stay out of her life forever.
You can tell her I'm an asshole.
Say you found this on your own.
I don't care, but you have
to tell her. Please.
Guys--
Yeah?
Okay.

TODD: Welcome to the best
workout routine in L.A.
Nothing motivates like fear.
So remember, once you're in there,
don't stop running.
If the clown dentists catch you,
they will bite you,
and they have very healthy teeth.
Nope, really. They will actually bite you,
and they do actually have rabies.
Exactly! And don't forget...
have fun in there!
We did it.
Between your no-nonsense approach
and my the-regular-amount-of-nonsense
approach,
we make a pretty good team.
Oh, um, I should tell you,
I'm actually asexual.
Oh! Uh, okay.
Huh.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I have to talk to you.

BOJACK: Make yourself at home.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I screwed up. I'm sorry.
I promised you'd do this show.
I don't know why. I just...
I needed something--

BOJACK: I'll do it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

BOJACK: You want me to do it, I'll do it.
God knows you've done enough for me.
What's wrong? I said I'd do it.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's just really hard to need people.

BOJACK: Yeah, but...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Yeah. Thank you.

BOJACK: Eh, it'll be good for me
to get out of the house anyway.
You want a drink?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Water.

BOJACK: Water? "Water" you pregnant?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Very much not so.

BOJACK: I heard you got a new boyfriend.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: We broke up.

BOJACK: Oh. Sounds like an asshole.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: He was actually the first guy I ever dated
who wasn't an asshole.

BOJACK: Well, onwards and upwards.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I heard you had a kid living with you?

BOJACK: No. She's got these adopted dads.
They're total dicks,
but they take care of her.
She'll have a good life.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh.

BOJACK: You ever think of adopting?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: More and more lately.

BOJACK: You should. You'd be a good mom.
The world needs good moms.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'll take that under advisement.

BOJACK: Well, I guess I'll see you on set.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm looking forward to it.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Now, back to normal.
Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

DIANE: Here we are. The rest of our lives.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I wanna show you something.
I had the contractor put this together
while we were gone. Close your eyes.

DIANE: Okay...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right. Open them.

DIANE: Oh, my God! It's--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Pretty cool, huh?

DIANE: Why would you do this?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: It's what you always wanted, right?

DIANE: It's too much. I didn't want it like this.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Like what?

DIANE: I don't know. I'm sorry.
This is great. I'm sorry.
Why would you think I would like this?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Because you told me
this is what you always dreamed of?

DIANE: I don't like big gestures like this!
How many times have I--?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, but this is--

DIANE: This was a fantasy,
something that belonged to me.
Why couldn't you have asked me--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever try
to surprise you, or do nice things.
Do you know how much it cost
to get 5,000 fake books?

DIANE: So I'm the bitch? Is that what you--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm sorry that I wanted to make our home
feel like a place
that you would want to live
that could be yours as well as mine!

DIANE: Why is that so important to you?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Because otherwise,
it feels like you're a guest.
And unlike the talking candlestick
in the aforementioned Disney film,
I don't want you to be that.
It makes me feel shitty.
Like you're just visiting here,
until the next thing
and you're gonna leave me
when you get bored
or you find something better.
Like Katrina did. Like Jessica did.

DIANE: You can't use your ex-wives against me.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I'm just telling you how I feel.
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.
This is not how I thought
this would go at all.

DIANE: Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.
Back to normal, right?
You know, sometimes I feel like
our marriage is like a magic eye poster.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I love those things.

DIANE: I know.
And it's messy. And at first glance,
it doesn't seem to make any sense.
And it's hard to figure out.
But sometimes,
if you squint at it just right,
everything lines up,
and it's the most perfect...
beautiful, amazing thing.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah. I know what you mean.

DIANE: But...
I'm so tired of squinting.

BOJACK: What?
Oh, Christ.
Hollyhock.
How are you?
They told you?
You're too smart
for your own good.
Really? Wow!
Right now? That's incredible.
What?
Are you kidding me? Why?
Nobody ever wants honeydew,
it's always there.
Thank you. Exactly.
Hollyhock, I'm sorry
I didn't take better care of you.
Yeah.
I should have protected you.
I really wanted to be
a good dad to you, Hollyhock.
Yeah. Good thing, I guess.
So, uh, Minneapolis, huh?
Did you rent a car or a cab?
Is there anything, uh, I can do?
I can upgrade your seats, or...
or send you better fruit.
Yeah. Yeah. Good.
