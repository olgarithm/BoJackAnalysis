TODD: Excuse me. Sorry!
Oh, hey, guys. I was eating a taco earlier
and I got salsa on my shirt.
I went to clean it off, but then when
I put my hands in the automatic dryer
I forgot I was still holding the taco.
I got my hands all greasy,
so I couldn't open the doorknob
for an hour.
What you guys talking about?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Fracktastic!
Meanwhile, all this talk
of whatever it is you're talking about
is making me hungry.

TODD: Mmm?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Cheese? Yes, please!
Well, then, color me "the people"
because I would also like
to know my opinion.

DIANE: Here's a thought:
maybe be against fracking.
It's terrible!
But that's just my opinion. You don't tell me how to do my job.
But also, fracking is the worst. I can't
believe you'd even consider endorsing it.
None of my business.
Gotta get to work. Love you!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Bye, hon!

DIANE: But seriously, seriously,
if you come out in support of fracking
I'm gonna be super upset. Bye!
Ohh. Are you a fan of charming
but inessential Will Smith movies?
Because, slight  Hitch,
I always show I'm empathic
by taking off my glasses dramatically,
but I kinda lost them.
Wow! This must be what I'd look like
to a starving shipwrecked person.
I was in a meeting with Princess Carolyn.
She was saying
I'm always forgetting stuff,
so I whipped off my glasses,
looked her square in the eye and said,
"I never forget a thing."
I might have left my glasses there.

TODD: I never know if I can handle anything.
That's what makes my life so exciting.
Mr. Peanutbutter, there's a delivery!
I can't sign for another man's mail.
That's how I ended up with the cremains
of Cornelius Vanderbilt.
It all started when a young Todd--
I don't have time for this!
I've got a job to do.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's Todd!

TODD: It's me!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You are just the guy I need.
You know the actress Courtney Portnoy?

TODD: I think so. She portrayed the formerly
portly consort in  The Seaport Resort ?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Courtly roles like
the formerly portly consort
are Courtney Portnoy's forte,
but she's got a new action movie
that's supposed to change her image:
Ms. Taken.
You know Mr. Taken
from the Taken  movies?
This is his niece.

TODD: Nice!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: This was supposed to be Courtney's
crossover coronation.
But that's sort of been thwarted,
unfortunately,
'cause Courtney's
purportedly falling short
of shoring up four-quadrant support.

TODD: Makes perfect sense so far.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: The public sees her as out of touch.
We need to make her seem relatable,
and the best way to do that
is to be seen dating a down-to-earth
boring nobody like yourself.
You can do that, right?
You're not doing anything.

TODD: I'm kind of busy today.
I gotta pick up these glasses,
and then tonight there was this meeting
I wanted to go to.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: This will take no time, I promise.
Meet her for lunch.
The paparazzi will show up,
pop some razzis.

TODD: I do love getting my picture taken.
It's proof I exist.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Marvelous!
Judah, prepare the press release.
"Portnoy finds joy in hoi polloi boy toy."

TODD: Here you go.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Thank you.

TODD: Ooh.
You got it, chief.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Okay.
Good morning!
Let's talk fracking.
Everyone has very strong opinions
about it,
and I want you all to know,
right here and right now,
I am taking a stand.
I am on... your side!
Good question.
I am specifically
on the side of the facts,
and also on the side of feelings.

Oh, excuse me,
would Mr. Peanutbutter
be willing to sign this letter
to our state government?

TODD: Yes. I'll write his name on anything.
And down goes Todd.
And up comes Todd!
Whoa!
Stay back!
Wait, wait, wait.
What's your first name?
And your last name?
Got it.
Wait, what's your last name?
How'd that happen? Test tubes?
Oh, of course.
Less of course.
That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!
I guess it's possible.
BoJack used to say his penis
is like sun-dried tomatoes:
back in the '90s it got into everything.
No, I get it. BoJack had one
of those spy kits, too.
He mostly just used the chloroform
on himself, though.
Sorry. I don't live there anymore.
And no one knows where he's been
for the last year.
I guess his house might have
Whoa!
Okay, there might be some hairs
in the shower drain,
but hard to know who they belong to.
Everyone who has sex with BoJack
usually takes a long shower afterwards.
Oh, no, BoJack.

BOJACK: What the... was...

TODD: Okay.

BOJACK: Blow? Who's got blow?
Save some for BoJack. Huh?
Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonna
yell at me? Can I have the blow first?

TODD: No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?
And I'm not going to yell at you.

BOJACK: And what is this?
Of the New Haven
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuacks?
That was a joke. Obviously, I've never
heard of your family and/or law firm.
That was also a joke. Todd, who is
this tough crowd you brought to my home?

TODD: Um, BoJack, this is your daught...
...dot-dot maid.

BOJACK: Way to build up the suspense.

TODD: To, uh, tidy up the place
in case you came back.

BOJACK: You got me a maid? Thank you.
Here I thought Channing Tatum
was a good neighbor
for picking up my mail while I was gone,
but you, and after all the things
I did to you,
I don't know how to tell you--

TODD: BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year,
and that's actually been
kind of working for me.
So, maybe it's better if we just
keep things like that, you know?

BOJACK: Oh. Okay. So then why did you hire me--
Oh, yeah, deliver me.

TODD: Can you tell me if this is a match?
Hollyhock.
Manheim-Mannheim-Gorilla-Rub-a-Dub-Dub
Zoolander-Hallelujah-something-McDonald's?
Duh!
1:00?
I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend!
No, it's fine.
Uh... do you want me to take you
somewhere else?
There's a Pony Roma's
at Universal CityWalk.
I can't do this.
Wait, Courtney!
Famous father? Hair? Sample?
DNA?
I gotta get back to Hollyhock.
Hollyhock, I need to get--
Did you clean anything?
So all you've done so far
is snoop around?
Yeah, I'm not sure we really need
to do this DNA test.
Okay, fine, then I just need you
to yank out a strand of hair
so I can take it down to the lab.
Um...
No.
No, but I can pull out some of my hair
at the same time,
so you don't have to do it alone.
Ow!

BOJACK: Todd, can I see you for a minute?
This maid is the worst.
I passed out again for some reason.
When I woke up, the house
was messier than when she started.
I don't mind someone else
in the house with me,
in case I start choking on pills
or have a funny take on current events
that demands an audience, but if she
can't do her job, I gotta fire her.

TODD: You can't do that!
Here, buzz up real nice,
take a nap, and while you're sleeping,
I'll get the maid to clean
so no one has to fire anyone.
Well, we did it.
Todd's phone, home of the Todd.
I don't want to be a manners police,
but a "hello" would be nice.
Ooh.
Jeez, I hope Randy's okay.
Yes. Should I have not done the thing
you literally told me to do?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, buddy, I just want you to know
that while Katrina is filled
with white-hot frustration
as she has been for much of this campaign,
I'm not mad.
I'm just nervous about
what Diane will do when she finds out.
But I've got a plan, and it stars you!

TODD: What? You want me to keep Diane away
from the TV, radio, and Internet?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Ohh! That's a way better idea than I had.
Yeah, do that.

TODD: Hollyhock, I gotta run.
I'll try to get the hairs tested today.
Just stay here and act maid-like.
Ah, okay.
Hey, look at me! I'm dancing.
The time is now! Don't miss out!

DIANE: Okay, Todd, that's some good dancing,
but I've got work to do
and you've been dancing for...
55 minutes?!

TODD: It's a new dance.
I call it the... come on, stall, Todd.
Gotta think of something to call
this fake dance you just made up.
Samba.

DIANE: Well, it's not like nobody
clicks on my articles.

TODD: Todd's phone.
I know when that Toddline bling.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What happened at the restaurant?
You disappeared before the paparazzi
even got there.
The whole point
was to get a picture with her.

TODD: Oh! Oops.
Uh, you want me to draw a picture
from memory?
How tall is she?
What is she, like, eight feet?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, plan B.
She's gonna be at the Sharc Jacobs
fashion show in 30 minutes.
There's an empty seat there
for her boyfriend, you.
Be there, get the photo. Got it?
Click.

TODD: So, I gotta go.

DIANE: How do I make people care
about important stuff
when all they want to do is read articles
about who got slayed
and who owned at the VMAs?

TODD: When I need Mr. Peanutbutter
to take his heartworm pills,
I always hide it in cheese
so he doesn't know
he's doing something he hates.
What if you take your important stuff
and hide it in some juicy gossip?

DIANE: That's actually a really good idea.
But... I don't know any gossip
and I wouldn't even know where to look.
The Internet?

TODD: No! Look at me!
Because I have potentially
earth-shattering inside info!
That beloved famous person, uh...
Channing Tatum may have
an illegitimate daughter
that's also a Cordovian refugee.

DIANE: Are you serious?

TODD: I have these two hairs.
One is from Channing,
the other is from a baby.
If the DNA lab confirms a match,
you have your story.

DIANE: Thanks, Todd. I owe you one.

TODD: Okay, but if it's a match,
please call me first.
'Cause, uh-- 'cause I love juicy gossip.
Where am I supposed to go?
Okay.
"El  Entrance?"
Gracias, sign. Muy bien.
Um...
Uh... okay.
And this is how I walk...
Uh... hmm... uh...
No! Wait!
Isn't fashion supposed to be for everyone?
Todd's phone.
Leave a message at the Todd.

DIANE: The DNA matched!
Looks like a wide variety of screen roles
isn't the only thing
Channing brought life to.

TODD: It's a match?
I gotta tell Holly... woo agents
to keep their eyes peeled
for a refugee baby
with abs to die for.
Where's Hollyhock?
I need to talk to her.

BOJACK: She's in maid heaven.

TODD: She's dead?!

BOJACK: Sorry, I meant she belongs in maid heaven
because she is a cleaning angel.

TODD: Where is she?

BOJACK: I sent her to Channing Tatum's house
to pay him back for collecting my mail
while I was out of town.
Looks like I missed quite a deal
at Pottery Barn.
Life is but an endless series
of missed opportunities,
some involving Pottery Barn.

TODD: Okay, I'm gonna--

BOJACK: Can you believe this?
Mr. Peanutbutter's running for governor.

TODD: I can believe it, because I've been around
for the last year.

BOJACK: Right. How's Diane feel about that?

TODD: You could ask her yourself.
Does she even know you're back?

BOJACK: I wanted to call her,
but I'm just not ready.
Nobody knows I'm back except you.
And Channing Tatum, and my pills guy,
and my booze guy,
my weed guy, my coke guy,
some smartass at Pizza Hut
who deserved an in-person finger-wagging,
and my maid.

TODD: And now she's at Channing Tatum's house?

BOJACK: I came back because
I wanted to fix things,
but now I don't know if I can.

TODD: Uh-huh.

BOJACK: I've been so lucky to have people
in my life who care about me.
I don't deserve any of them.
I definitely don't deserve
to have a friend as amazing
and generous and forgiving
and thoughtful as...

TODD: Yeah? Oh.

BOJACK: Channing Tatum.
I'm only gonna hurt him
like I've hurt everyone else.
I was a fool to think I could just
jump back into a new relationship.
Can you go over to Channing Tatum's house,
tell him I won't be his friend?
I can't break another heart.
Not today, not Channing.

TODD: Okay.
Hollyhock, I need to tell you something.
Are you sure you want to know?
I don't know if BoJack is ready
for a normal relationship with anyone.
Well, then good news.
I got the results and...
it's not a match.
Yeah. Good news, right?

DIANE: Hello? Anybody home?

Get down! Go, go, go! Shh.

DIANE: I can hear someone in there.
Channing?
Jenna Dewan?
Their daughter, Everly Elizabeth?

TODD: Uh, it's me... 
Channing Tatum.
I'm in the middle of, uh,
channing right now,
but you can come back... tatum?

DIANE: Listen, I'm a reporter.
I tested your DNA
against another sample's DNA,
and apparently the two are related.
You're a father.

TODD: Okay. Thanks!

DIANE: I was going to write a story
and drag your name through the mud
just because I thought a couple more
people would click on an article I wrote.
But I don't think that's
the kind of journalist I want to be.
Maybe I'm not cut out
for this line of work.
Sorry to bother you.

TODD: Uh... Hey, I obviously don't
know you because I am Channing Tatum,
the guy from  Green Lantern
or whatever,
and you are a nobody,
but you came all the way over here
to warn me about something
you hadn't even written yet.
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum,
I'd say you're exactly the kind
of journalist we need in this world.

DIANE: Wow!
That doesn't sound at all
like Channing Tatum's voice,
but that is the kind of thing I would want
Channing Tatum to say to me,
so thanks, Channing.
Love half your movies!

TODD: That was a close one,
huh, Hollyhock?
Hollyhock?
Todd's phone. What do you want?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So, I see lots of pictures of you
at the fashion show,
but none of you with Courtney.

TODD: Oh, crap!
Hi.
Uh, why are you wearing my clothes?
Oh. So, uh...
what's it like being a movie star?
Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.
Ohh.
Okay.
Yeah. Talking's good.
You know, there was a meeting
I was supposed to go to tonight,
but I don't think I'm gonna go.
I don't know if I'm ready.
What if it's not everything
I want it to be?
Sometimes the idea of something
is better than the truth, you know?
Yeah, that makes sense.
Hooray! I'm confused!
Hollyhock? Are you here?

BOJACK: No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.

TODD: BoJack, I gotta tell you, um...
Hollyhock is your daughter.

BOJACK: What do you mean?

TODD: She's your daughter.

BOJACK: I don't understand.

TODD: She has Horseman DNA.
You're her father.

BOJACK: That's impossible. I'm BoJack.

TODD: She didn't want me to tell you,
but I thought you should know.

BOJACK: I guess I don't blame her.
I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.

TODD: BoJack...

BOJACK: Look what I do to people
I'm supposed to care about.
I had sex with the one person
I've ever seen you be in love with.

TODD: I guess they're not gonna put you
in the best friends hall of fame,
but I don't know that I loved her.
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.

BOJACK: Don't say that.
You do so much for everybody.
And all you ever asked for
was a roof over your head
and the occasional s'more in a baguette.

TODD: I'm telling you,
it's a million-dollar idea.

BOJACK: I got more of you than I ever deserved.
If you never talk to me again
I just want you to know
that I appreciate it,
and I appreciate you.

TODD: Thanks.
It was shitty
what you did with Emily, but, um...
I think I'm... asexual.

BOJACK: A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant?
Harassment lawsuit waiting to happen?

TODD: No. Asexual, not sexual.

BOJACK: Ohh.

TODD: I'm sure you think that's weird.

BOJACK: Are you kidding? That's amazing.
Sometimes I wish I was asexual.
Maybe then I wouldn't have
a  strain of herpes.

TODD: You have multiple strains--

BOJACK: I know.
The joke only works with the "a".

TODD: It actually feels nice
to finally say it out loud.
I am an asexual person.
I am asexual.

BOJACK: That's great.
So if you're not mad about Emily--

TODD: It wasn't just Emily, BoJack,
and I don't know if I'm ready for us
to be friends again yet.

BOJACK: Oh. Okay.

TODD: But we can be more than not-friends.

BOJACK: You know, for an asexual,
more than not-friends is probably
as good as it gets, right?

TODD: I'm not really at a place yet
where I want to joke about it.

BOJACK: Got it, got it, totally.

TODD: But it feels good to talk about it.

BOJACK: Well, if you ever need a place to crash,
that couch--

TODD: I'm gonna go.

BOJACK: Oh.
Right now?

TODD: Welcome back, BoJack.
It's good to see you.

BOJACK: Uh...
Hmm.
Todd?
