BOJACK: Yep.
That's right.
I lied!
There's no Carla Mercedes Benzbrown.
I have no idea who your mother is.
I don't want to have a relationship
lying to each other.
I meant everything else I said.
I'll do everything I can
to help find your mom.
To be honest, moms aren't all that great.
In fact, in my experience,
they're soulless succubi
born fully formed from the ass of Satan.
Oh, my mom?
No, you cannot meet my mom
because she's... dead.
Dead mom.
I lied again. My mom's not dead.
That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.
Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.
Oh, this spectacular elder care facility,
she has her own private room
with a nice view,
'round-the-clock medical care,
and plenty of other seniors
to say casually cruel things to
under a passive-aggressive veil
of plausible deniability.
I want to say Whispering Pines.
Whistling Pines?
Something with a W. Winter's Bone?
Fine!
Yes. I promise.
I am not gonna lie to you ever again.
No.
I lied. I lied about the fudgesicle.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh... oh.
That is not good.
Thoughts and prayers.

TODD: Tragedy like this
really puts things in perspective.
Like, what are we doing
sitting in a conference room?
Life is short. We should have
this meeting at a water park.
Whoa! A water park
where people have meetings.
Maybe that's the movie.
I'm Courtney's asexual fake fianc√©.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: We should probably lose
the movie theater shootout.
What?
I gotta take this.
BoJack?

BOJACK: Hi.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Where have you been?

BOJACK: Listen.
I'm sorry.
I was an awful boyfriend to you.
I was an awful client,
and I was an awful friend.
This last year I spent some time away
and it made me realize
how special the people in my life are.
And you might be
the most special of them all.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wow, BoJack.
I-- I appreciate that.

BOJACK: Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,
do you remember the name
of that super nice elder care facility
that we both agreed was the best place
for my mom to run out the clock?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh, pluck a duck.
It's called Walnut Springs.

BOJACK: Walnut Springs!
I knew there was a W in there. Bye!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What?

BOJACK: I feel like I didn't strike the right tone
in the last phone call.
I really am sorry,
and the most important thing is,
you know how dedicated I am
to making things right again.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay. Thank you.

BOJACK: Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,
turns out there's a few Walnut Springses
in the SoCal area.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's the one in Santa Barbara, dummy!

BOJACK: Yeesh! Cranky much? Who died?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: A lotta people!
Sorry, what did I miss?

TODD: I'm just saying,
if people have the right pumped-up kicks,
maybe they can outrun the bullets.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: All this talk of gun violence
is depressing.
Ms. Taken  is a movie about empowerment.
We just have to keep the story
on Courtney,
and not on the depressingly
unstoppable rise
of real-life gun violence in this country,
thoughts and prayers.
Thoughts and prayers.

DIANE: Oh.
Hello?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Diane!
I got an exclusive for you.
You are going to write a glowing feature
about my client and her new movie.

DIANE: Why would I...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: You know Courtney Portnoy.
You probably recall when she soared
as the thorny horticulturist
in  One Sordid Fortnight
With the Short-Skirted Sorceress.

DIANE: Uh...

PRINCESS CAROLYN: How would you enjoy joining Portnoy
for a scorched soy porterhouse pork
four-courser at Koi?

DIANE: Wait, what?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Glorify your source,
but don't make it feel forced, of course,
and try the borscht. Smooches!

DIANE: Hey--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: And that's how you do it, folks.

BOJACK: Uh... twinge of guilt, twinge of guilt,
trying to remember, no.
Definitely not.
You didn't know my mom.
But, Mom...
Oh, uh...
Hi, Mom.
Here we go.
Yes, Mom, I never visit. You got me.
Okay, we're doing this?
She knows.
This is just like when she pretended
not to recognize me
after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.
I had to get a ride home with the pianist
who liked to tickle a lot more
than just the ivories.
Stop calling me Henrietta!
Nobody here's named Henrietta!
Mom, do you really not know who I am?
Me, famous BoJack?
Oh. Uh, okay.

DIANE: Yeah, you put your pants on
one leg at a time.
Well, right, of course,
why else have trouser-maidens?
Just leave us alone, okay?
First,  konichiwa  is not a compliment,
it's Japanese for hello.
Second of all, I'm not Japanese.
Whoa!
What...
...the...
shit was that?
Why do you even have a gun?
No, I am very anti-gun.
In fact, I think the whole idea of guns
is inherently--
Holy shit, I'm holding a gun.
How long has this been in my hand?
It actually feels kind of nice.
You have your own gun range?
Whoa...

BOJACK: You came out of nowhere.
Thank you, very colorful.
Is that right?
That's not happening.
Seeing my mom
is like a Terrence Malick movie.
Every ten years or so is bearable,
but more than that
and it starts to get annoying.
Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!
Come on, Hollyhock,
let's blow this Jell-O stand.
Hollyhock you can do anything
if you believe in yourself.
Why?
Fine.
We'll come back. Happy?
See ya next week.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Hey, are we out of milk?

DIANE: I can pick up some after work.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Great. Also, real quick follow-up,
why are you holding a gun?

DIANE: Oh, my God!
Did I drive all the way home
without realizing I was holding a gun?
No wonder that guy at the gas station
didn't charge me for the Red Vines.
Did I rob a gas station?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Classic Diane shenanigans.
Or as I call them, "Diane-igans."
All right, be safe.

DIANE: Hmm.
Let's get one thing
out of the way right now.
If you're a man,
you're not gonna get it.
Some of you think you get it.
You want to get it.
You listen, nod
and say all the right things
when we tell you our stories.
But you still can't actually know
what it feels like
to constantly have your guard up.
In parking garages,
walking the street, even at work.
I'm tired of trying
to help men understand
how it feels to be a woman.
Starting now,
I'm doing what it takes
to put the power in my own hands.
That's why I own a gun.

BOJACK: Yup, she sure remembers
all the important people.
That's not Crackerjack, that's me.
Thirty seconds
after that picture was taken
you yelled at me
for getting ice cream on my shorts.
Yeah, you want to look pretty
for when Death comes to visit.
Okay. You two enjoy each other.
I'm gonna go see
if I can seduce a lonely dowager
into giving me her night-night pills.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Again with the crazy gunmen.

TODD: Ha! That sounds hilarious!
Imagining that funny movie
you just described.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Okay, what do all these shootings
have in common?
Men! What if we played up
the "Ms." in  Ms. Taken ?
In a world of increasing terror,
our movie tells women
they don't have to be afraid anymore.

TODD: When you put it that way,
it almost sounds like these mass shootings
could be a good thing for the movie.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No, no, no, of course not.
They're a terrible tragedy.
And my thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.
But...
anything that makes women feel unsafe
might actually help our box office.

TODD: But you don't want women to feel unsafe.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Of course not!
But if they already do feel unsafe,
there's no reason not to capitalize.
Exactly, we're not making them
feel unsafe.
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,
from there being more mass shootings.

BOJACK: Ta-da!
It's not a book, it's a DVD case.
We did a special episode about elder care.
Now we're gonna watch it
and learn how to handle this bitch.
I think you can pick that up
through context.
Season two, episode 12.
"I'm Ready For My Close-Up,
Mr. Dementia."
Hey, Ethan, who's your friend?
Here we go, again.
Mom?
Daughter, the bikini model?
Whoa, whoa, Ethan,
this man is our guest!
Uh...
Huh.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You know I hate guns, right?

DIANE: I know.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Although my official stated
political opinion
is I respect the Second Amendment
but I think some gun purchases
should require the barest amount
of background checks.

DIANE: Mr. Peanutbutter,
you know I hate guns, too.
Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.
But being a gun owner finally makes me
feel as safe walking down the street
as a man gets to feel all the time.
And that's an incredible feeling
I'm not ready to give up yet.
If you can frack under our house,
I should get to have a gun.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: All right, that's fair.
I'm really proud we've found a way
to keep our personal lives
and our political lives compartmentalized.

DIANE: Me, too.
You have no idea...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yes. I have no idea?

DIANE: Is your bubble of privilege so thick...

What's with humans and guns?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You're addicted to these things.

DIANE: And what is it with men
and not wanting women to feel safe?

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't--

DIANE: This is a gendered issue...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Excuse me!

DIANE: ...make no mistake.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't think women...

DIANE: You can't sympathize...

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: ...running around with guns
makes anybody safer.

DIANE: Yeah. That's the danger.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I don't--

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Excuse me.

DIANE: Not the men
who commit 90 percent of murders,
it's the crazy hysterical women
you gotta worry about!
Yes, yes! Fill my chamber
with your powerful bullets!

BOJACK: 
Because you love that BoJack, right?
Which dumb show? New one or old one?
The old one. That episode got us
into the TV Guide
"Cheers and Jeers" column.
We did not get a "Cheers."
We have to have this conversation now,
on the way to Dad's funeral?
There was so much more
I wanted to say to him.
Something tells me
I'm gonna regret this.
Uh-huh.
Not painful, boring. This place sucks.
If I'm not getting credit
for coming, what's the point?
Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?
Put on a live episode
of  Horsin' Around  in the nursing home.
Good thinking, Hollyhock.
We'll do a  Horsin' Around
here at the home.
She'll love it
because it's her son BoJack.
Then after the show,
I'll come out and say hello.
And she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?"
When her eyes spark with recognition,
I'm gonna sit down next to her,
I'm gonna squeeze her hand
and get real close and say...
"Fuck you, Mom."
I can finally tell her off!
I'm gonna say, "Look at you,
you old piece of shit,
rotting in a nursing home!"
Now I have the power!
Oh, it's gonna be great!
I can't wait to see the look on her face.
Okay, let's do this. Let's put on a show!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey!
Terrible tragedy.
Thoughts and prayers.
We really have to do something
about these men who just go...
A woman mass shooter?
Oh, no, that really is bad news!

DIANE: Look, all I'm saying is
maybe you shouldn't blame women
for wanting guns.
Maybe you should blame
the constant societal messaging
that tells us we are safe only as long
as the men around us allow us to be.
So if you have a problem
with women carrying firearms,
you can roll up your sleeves
and actually work to create a society
where women feel safe and equal,
or you can just ban all guns.
I really thought that was gonna go the other way.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wow, Diane.
You just passed sensible gun legislation.

DIANE: I can't believe this country hates women
more than it loves guns.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No?

BOJACK: You'll be fine.
Just remember to enunciate.
It helps if you imagine
performing for the back row.
Shh! Here they come. Gladys, hit it!
Too bad I could never run for president,
'cause I love waffling!
Olivia, you usually love
my breakfast humor.
Why so glum, sugarplum?
We just started. Let's at least
get through the first act
before we judge ourselves
too harshly, huh?
I wonder if there's a way
to make math fun.
Oh, God.
You think we should
still finish the episode, or...?
Can you recommend another facility?
Okay, who are they?
Do you have their number?
Oh. Uh...
Okay. If she really doesn't have
much time left.
But if we get to this time next year,
she's still hanging on,
you will be getting
a very strongly worded letter, mister.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: It's a shame. It was a great movie.
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.

BOJACK: Oh, God.
I keep thinking
about all the things I never said
because I was so sure
there'd be other days to say them.
It's not the same.
I should have done it
back when she knew who I was,
back when it would mean something.
But now, she's gonna die
and she's never gonna know
just how much I hate her.
Yeah? You're not just saying that?
Yeah, but I really wanted
to say it to her face.
You really think so?
