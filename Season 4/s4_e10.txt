BOJACK: Give it a moment.
Nothing gets by me, Tina.
Uno what I'm thinking?
I don't think you have any blues.
I think you put the wild card down,
and chose blue,
because you want us
to think you have blues.
Uh, excuse me.
I am employing
a little something called "strategy."
And I am taking my time because
I enjoy being the center of attention.
And until I put a card down,
you have to listen.
Well, since you're being so impatient,
I'm gonna put my thing down,
flip it and reverse it back to Tina.
So you  did  have blues.  Touch√©.
It's your turn, Beatrice.
You okay, Hollyhock?
You think I've never seen
an old niner-sixer before?
Whoa, are-- are you okay?
Did you cut yourself?
It's okay. I know what to do.
You need some alcohol, ice,
a squeeze of lemon.
You'll forget all about your cut.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Much like Ernest Contralto
killed those innocent children
after he pedophiled them,
with those very hands.
Your hands are being
really aggressive right now.
Watch out! They're attacking your face!

DIANE: I'm working on another big piece
about how Jessica Biel is owned
by private prison lobbyists, who want--
Well...
Why would--
Ugh!
Grilled cheese?
Well, today I just want to know
what you smell like.
Your perfume's called "B"-list?
"B"-list. Like a "B"-list celebrity.
Yeah I think we're saying the same thing.
No, thanks.
Well, I wouldn't flatter
yourself too much.
He's very enthusiastic
about smelling in general.
What? No.
Yeah, I bet.
Yeah. I think I do.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Whoa!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: Yeah, who'da thunk it?

DIANE: Who knew?
I knew. I put the avocado thing
in the story on purpose,
I knew people wouldn't like it.
So just for the record, I "thunk" it.
Even though it doesn't matter.
I don't need credit.
But it does, if I didn't do that,
it wouldn't have happened.
So, it's because of me.
Me. I just told you.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: We did it, didn't we?

DIANE: We did!

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: You and me, working together,
both contributing the same amount.

DIANE: Well, I wrote the article
that got Woodchuck elected governor.
You're the one that made him
not governor in the first place.

MR. PEANUTBUTTER: I set 'em up. You knock 'em down.

TODD: It would be funnier
if your name was Betty Buenaventura
of the Better Business Bureau.
Oh.
Isn't laughter the best medicine?
Well, what if I said my business
was for entertainment purposes?
Ah, everyone's a critic.
Wait! Wait.
What if my clown dentists
put on a show?
A delightful, whimsical,
non-terrifying clown-stravaganza?
You would have to agree
we were a legitimate
business then, right?
Give us a week. We'll put on a show.
If you don't laugh,
I'll dissolve the business
and release all my clown dentists
into the woods,
where they'll never bother anyone again.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ooh!
Excuse me.
Get outta my way.

TODD: Like, hooked in a funny way.
You call that funny?
That's not funny. It's sad.
Uh, no! Abraham Lincoln
and some weird flat house
are two sides of the same coin.
Take five, Picarello.
I've got a week
to whip these dentists into clowns.
But they're just not silly or wacky
or prone to kooky hijinks of any kind!
Should you be drinking that?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Why not? I got no baby or boyfriend.
Might as well get blotto, right? 

TODD: Um, shouldn't you be at work?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: I'm recal-bibrating.
Oh!
Ohh...

TODD: Hey, maybe you should--

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Judah, look at my phone! Judah!

TODD: You have a meeting with Flip McVicker.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Tell his gal I'm running ten minutes late.

TODDL What gal?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: So, you're a writer?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for the business card.
Oh?
This sounds fabulous.
Why don't you write a script,
we'll go from there?
Oh, you brought it with you.
Yeah. Look, Flip, before I even read this,
I should tell you
that this town's a total crapshoot.
Odds of the right person
finding your material
and connecting with it
are a million to... one.
It's not stupid. I believe in you.
I don't know how else to describe it
other than this feeling
of supreme warmth came over me,
like this is what I've been waiting for
my whole life.

TODD: That's amazing!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Todd, the world is dark and scary
and full of creepy clown dentists...

TODD: They're working very hard
to be less creepy.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: But when I hold this script in my hands,
I have hope.
I gotta get this made.
What do I always say?
"What's the difference
between an agent and a manager?"

TODD: Uh, managers are always
talking about the differences
between agents and managers
and agents don't as much?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: No! Managers can produce!
This script is a sign.
I gotta get off my ass
and produce this baby.
Todd? 
Get me a meeting with Turtletaub.
Set something up with his gal.
Who is this gal?

TODD: Okay. Clentists, assemble!
Wipe those serious looks
off your faces and listen up!
We gotta help Princess Carolyn,
but also we gotta prep
for our big show next week.
What a ludicrous notion!
Doctor Picarello,
we might make a clown out of you yet!
This next part is critical. Remain wacky.
This is a highly frivolous situation!
Now, Doctor Boing Boing!
All right, Princess Carolyn, sit tight.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Whoa!

TODD: Deliver the goods,
Doctor Boing Boing!

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Ah!
Whoa!
Lenny, thanks for making time.
Uh, new perfume, "Sealist," by Seal.
Now let's get to brass stacks.
So it's a hot young writer.
It's TV. It's me producing.
Just look at this script.
I know it's gonna knock your socks off.
Yeah.
That's huge! That's so many people!
Let's set the pitch for next week.
He's this grizzled
but very good-looking detective
who gets sucked back in to something.
Not yet, but...
No! Fish!
Oh, whoa... ooh, spinny.

TODD: Don't let Turtletaub
get back to his office.
Doctor Picarello,
you gotta revive Princess Carolyn.
Give her ten cc's of honka-honka.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Oh!
Okay, okay, how about Aaron Eckhart?
He owes me a favor
and he can disappear into any role.
Tony Shalhoub!
Please. I need this so bad.
You don't understand.
This project is my ba...
my ba...
It's my baby.
No!
There's gotta be a name
that does something for you.
Uh, Jack Huston... Hugh... Hugh Jackman.
BoJack Horseman!
Corbin Bernsen.
Ben Mendelsohn.
BoJack. That's an idea.
Right, but--
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.
I'm saying, there are a lotta guys...
Of course I can.
Uh, will do.

TODD: Guys, that was amazing!
But if we're going to convince Yolanda
we're ready for the big top,
we need to really hunker down
over the next week
and put together a show
so undeniably hilarious
and life-affirming,
that she has no choice but to say...
Hooray!
Oh, no! My hooray was premature!
All right, you heard the lady.
Get into the car, everyone.
I'm taking you to the woods,
out by the old abandoned insane asylum,
near the elementary school
where you belong.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: What? Why?
Thank you, Stuart.
You mean the pitch meeting.
No, Stuart. Thank you.

BOJACK: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, BoJack, great news!

BOJACK: Bad time. Can't talk.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wait, just listen for a...
Okay.
Here we go, baby.

BOJACK: Oh, man!
You are not finding what you need!
The deck is a harsh mistress, Tina.
Hollyhock, you gotta get in here!
Tina is drawing so many cards.
It's amazing.
Hollyhock! Hollyhock?
Hollyhock?
Yes, for the third time,
her name is "Hollyhock."
And her last name?
Manheim-Mannheim, uh, Steamroller...
I think there's a Lopez
in the mix somewhere?
A Chung maybe?
Okay, just... any information
you can give me
on the 17-year-old horse girl
who came here by ambulance
15 minutes ago would be
of interest to my friend,
Mr. Franklin's... friend, Mr. Hamilton.
Guerrero!
Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...
Robinson...
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack.
That's her name.
And she's about five-eight.
And she's 17,
her birthday is in September.
And... she looks like me.
And she loves apples
but hates apple sauce.
And she's funny.
But she isn't mean.
Which is pretty remarkable,
'cause a lot of 17-year-olds think
you have to be mean to be funny,
but Hollyhock is very sweet,
even if she can be sarcastic.
But she has this smile with...
Does that help?
I'm not leaving here
until I get to see her.
Ugh.
Huh?
Excuse me.
Did you say Hollyhock? Are you...
Hello, yes! Yeah. Thank God you're here.
I'm BoJack Horseman.
Okay. Yep.
Okay.
Got it.
Okay.
How's Hollyhock?
They wouldn't give me information.
No, I know. I just... Is she okay?
What happened?
What? No.
What was she on? I had no idea.
I was.
Can I see her? Can I talk to her?
No, I didn't...
Okay, I feel like there's a lot
of male energy right now.
Why don't I come back in a couple hours?
Give Hollyhock a chance to rest
before I talk to her.
Look, if I could just...
Okay.
No, no. No, no, no.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
She's gone, Mom.
Thanks, Mom.
Right. How did I not see it?
All this time, I thought
you were a terrible parent.
And you were.
But I blew it even worse.
It turns out being a parent is impossible,
so I guess I can't be that mad at you.
Maybe we deserve each other.
Jesus, you two and your coffee.
Wait. No.
What did you put in this?
"Chub-B-Gone?"
This whole time.
Of course it was you.
No. All this "I-don't-know-where-I-am
or-who-my-son-stuff" is,
is officially not cute anymore.
You ruined the one good thing I had.
The one thing I didn't ruin myself,
but of course I did
because I thought it was a good idea
to give you one more chance.
Stop. You are out of chances.

BOJACK: What?

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Hey, BoJack, great news!

BOJACK: Bad time. Can't talk.

PRINCESS CAROLYN: Wait, just listen--

BOJACK: No, I said "worst available room."
Noted.
Oh! In that case, please watch me
not reach for my wallet.
Well, this is your life now.
This is what it all added up to.
You, by yourself, in this room.
Best of luck. See ya never.
Ugh. Bye, Mom.
